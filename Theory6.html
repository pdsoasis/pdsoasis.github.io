<div align="center"><font size="4"><strong>If you look at the many dragon riders, 
        Lundi, the Sky Rider, Kyle, and Edge, from each Panzer Dragoon game, they 
        have all acquired and used an ancient age gun on their adventures with 
        the dragon. This aspect of the Panzer Dragoon Series brings us to the 
        hunter Radgam in the Town of Zoah. When you visit his house in the Liberal 
        District, you will find an ancient age gun on a shrine, similar to the 
        one all of the previous dragon riders used. Since every Dragon Rider possessed 
        an ancient age gun on their journey with the dragon, could Radgam himself 
        be the true 4th dragon rider? </strong> 
        <p><strong><br>
          <em>(There's a gun on the shrine. A blessed gun for a good hunt?)</em></strong></p>
        <p><em><strong>(It's broken now, but was a powerful weapon a long time 
          ago.)</strong></em></p>
        <p><em><strong> {Radgam:}<br>
          Don't touch that!</strong></em></p>
        <p><em><strong>{Edge:}<br>
          I... I'm sorry.<br>
          It's such a rare gun, so...</strong></em></p>
        <p><em><strong>{Radgam:}<br>
          Oh, you can tell, eh?<br>
          This is no decoration!<br>
          It's a shrine for my fallen comrades.<br>
          We fought in countless battles...<br>
          They were all killed by the monsters,<br>
          leaving me, and one other...</strong></em></p>
        <p><strong>Could this imply that Radgam and his comrades were once on 
          an adventure with the dragon, fighting countless battles with ancient 
          age monsters, just like edge, Gash and Azel? </strong></p>
        <p><strong><em>{Radgam:}<br>
          The Guardian Fire protects Zoah.<br>
          Its power keeps the monsters at bay.<br>
          The people are safe as long as they<br>
          stay in the city.<br>
          Hey, rookie, do you believe that the<br>
          hunters serve a greater purpose?</em></strong></p>
        <p><em><strong>{Edge:}<br>
          Yeah, I can feel it.<br>
          Everyone has their own destiny.<br>
          That's why I travel, and that's<br>
          why I fight.</strong></em></p>
        <p><strong>Did Radgam have a greater purpose, a journey with the dragon? 
          Did he once stop an ancient creation from destroying the world in an 
          unknown adventure?</strong></p>
        <p><strong><em>{Radgam:}<br>
          It's not a good idea to get<br>
          involved with seekers, boy.</em></strong></p>
        <p><strong>Was Radgam once a Seeker? Could Seekers including Gashe&#8217;s 
          mentor Lundi, have aided him in his journey with their vast knowledge 
          of the Ancient Age, resulting in a tragedy?</strong></p>
        <p><strong><em>{Radgam:}<br>
          You should see the world<br>
          while you're young.<br>
          You have great potential.<br>
          Don't let it go to waste.</em></strong></p>
        <p><strong>Good advice to someone who potentially had a great adventure 
          with the dragon. He most certainly would have seen many things in his 
          adventures and would have experienced many battles. It is very possible 
          that his adventure could have taken place just after Panzer Dragoon 
          (Imperial year 90 A.F.- 99 A. F.) and ended just before PDS started. 
          An adventure in a different location than the places in the Panzer Dragoon 
          universe we have already seen. We will never truly know if Radgam was 
          a dragon rider, but his possession of an ancient age gun just has to 
          make you wonder&#8230;. Was he the true 4th dragon rider?</strong></p>
