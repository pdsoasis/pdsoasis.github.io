      <p><font size="4"><br>
        (1/2) A week has past since we came to the excavation site, accepting 
        the Empire's commission. They are desperately trying to find something. 
        The director of this excavation site has been looking for over 20 years 
        already. Crazy. </font></p> <p><font size="4">(2/2) It appears that, once 
        again, they have failed to find whatever it is that they're looking for.<br>
        As always, we're left in the dark.<br>
        </font></p> 
      <p><font size="4">25th day of 10th month</font></p> 
      <p><font size="4">(1/2) Thanks to that huge wind net,<br>
        there's no way a monster could get<br>
        in here. This job is probably going to be easier than I first thought.<br>
        </font></p> <p><font size="4">(2/2) This evening, I talked with the director. 
        Apparently, only 'smart' folks can enter the Imperial<br>
        Academy. He said enrolling in a<br>
        normal school should be his first<br>
        priority. I'll talk to Edge.</font></p> <p><font size="4"><br>
        8th day of 11th month </font></p> 
      <p><font size="4"><br>
        (1/2) As always, nothing new at the<br>
        excavation site, all they've dug<br>
        up is ancient garbage. I talked with the director again. He says it'll 
        cost a lot of dynes just to enroll Edge in school. </font></p> <p><font size="4">(2/2) 
        I'm worried that there's only a few good years left in me and I<br>
        won't be able to earn enough money to pay for Edge's schooling.<br>
        </font></p> 
      <p><font size="4">20th day of 12th month<br>
        </font></p> <p><font size="4">(1/4) Why did I start writing this<br>
        diary? It's not like me at all. I guess it's because of him. How many 
        times have I told him that I think of him as my son? But I've never done 
        anything that a parent would do. </font></p> <p><font size="4">(2/4) Unlike 
        me, barely literate, Edge is a smart kid. I want him<br>
        to be enrolled in a school in the Empire. Being a mercenary in the middle 
        of nowhere is not a job for an innocent boy.<br>
        </font></p> <p><font size="4">(3/4) After this job is done, I<br>
        plan to take him to the Capital. I want to do more than write in my<br>
        diary, I should start studying myself. I don't want him to be ashamed 
        of me when he grows up. </font></p> <p><font size="4">(4/4) Will Edge 
        ever call me...<br>
        father?</font></p>

        (1/3) An envoy from Meccania came to purchase a grown Coolia. Meccanian 
        officers always pay well, so there was plenty of food on the table that 
        night. But I had to clean up the dead Coolia's remains, so I didn't feel 
        like eating. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(2/3) 'Destroy the mutants', it is the<br>
        village's code. The mutant Coolias cannot be tamed, and no one will buy 
        them. Besides, they are believed to be a bad omen.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(3/3) But to me, Coolias are all<br>
        the same. I can't believe that blue-<br>

        (1/1) Loth became feverish. She was near delivery, so I had to take care 
        of her overnight. If I allowed her to die, I would be punished for sure. 
        It's not like I really could do<br>
        anything for her, they just needed a caretaker. My bad luck. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">26th day of first month<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(1/2) Unfortunately, Loth passed away. 
        My father whipped me and sent me to bed hungry. But none of that mattered. 
        I lied about the baby. I told them it was stillborn, but it actually was 
        sleeping quietly in the barn. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(2/2) I didn't mean to break the code... 
        only, I couldn't kill him...<br>
        because Lagi had... a pair of wings!.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">27th day of first month<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(1/2) I named the little Coolia 'Lagi'. 
        If anyone knew the reason why I decided to take care of him,<br>
        they would just laugh at me. All the legends and scriptures of our village 
        describe a dragon. And Lagi reminds me of that dragon. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(2/2) I know it's all childish dreaming, 
        but I want to see Lagi grow up. If he could actually fly...<br>
        I could be like the dragon rider in the fairy tales I was told in my childhood.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4"><br>
        8th day of 9th month<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(1/1) Lagi's growth rate is amazing. At 
        this rate, he could be as big as<br>
        a full-grown Coolia in a year. His wings are strengthening too. I took 
        him running today, and just for an instant, he actually floated. Lagi 
        may really fly! </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4"><br>
        19th day of 10th month</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4"><br>
        (1/3) Yesterday, my whole life ended. The home where I lived, everyone 
        in the village, they're gone. Dead. The airship appeared out of nowhere, 
        attacked without reason, and turned my village into nothing but ashes... 
        </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(2/3) Disaster struck while we were<br>
        outside the village, practicing.<br>
        Somehow, I couldn't even cry. The<br>
        village was in flames before me, yet I couldn't accept it. It was,<br>
        however, what Lagi did next that<br>
        sent shivers down my spine.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(3/3) What Lagi fired towards the<br>
        ancient airship... It was the legendary 'arrows of light'. My dream had 
        become a reality, but the villagers had paid for it with their souls.

        <p align="left"><font size="4">(1/3) Three days have passed since weleft. 
          Some people in a caravan<br>
          were kind enough to share food andwater with us. They also told uswhat 
          they saw. They said the<br>
          ancient airship was heading for<br>
          the border, towards the Empire. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4">(2/3) Why do I follow that airship? To 
          be honest, I don't know...<br>
          Revenge? Well, perhaps at first...<br>
          But something more draws me to it.<br>
          </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4">(3/3) Revenge is not the only reason. Ifeel 
          as if I have a mission to fulfil. I just cannot allow the<br>
          ancient airship to reach its destination. As long as I have<br>
          Lagi's power, I must follow it. <br>
          </font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="4"><br>
          (1/4) We were ambushed near the border. They used ancient weapons. The 
          battle was completely different to anything I've experienced before. 
          Vehicles that resembled monsters flew in the sky and their weapons blazed 
          demonic flames. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4">(2/4) It was like being in the middle of 
          warring Gods, only the combatants were people. Even if the vehicles 
          were hell spawn, the riders were still human. But I had to protect myself. 
          I sent them all to fiery deaths. Without hesitation.<br>
          </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4">(3/4) While fighting, I felt as if I<br>
          became one with Lagi. There was no fear. I was filled only with a sense 
          of duty. Was it really my will, or was it the dragon<br>
          controlling me all along? </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4">(4/4) Lagi has developed another power. 
          After the battle, Lagi began<br>
          glowing. Then, suddenly, he shed<br>
          his skin. My only guess is this is how dragons grow.<br>
          </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4">14th day of 11th month</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4"><br>
          (1/3) Above the forest, the Imperial<br>
          Fleet attacked us. It wasn't their<br>
          weapons, or even their sheer<br>
          numbers that frightened me. It was<br>
          that I would be forced to kill even more people. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4">(2/3) We escaped into the forest, but the 
          creature I saw feasting on the charred corpses in my village<br>
          waited for us there. Maybe the<br>
          beast is connected with the ship<br>
          somehow. I feel I am close.<br>
          </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4">(3/3) After killing the monster, I<br>
          entered an ancient ruin. Inside, hordes of hideous creatures<br>
          attacked us like a hungry storm. We found an immense underground lake. 
          Water may bring life, but here was only the smell of death. </font></p>

      <p><font size="4"><br>
        (1/3) I've spent two days in Georgius.That ancient airship has drawn me 
        further than I ever imagined. My old life is but a distant memory. This 
        crusade has left me lonely. </font></p>
      <p><font size="4">(2/3) Lagi's body has continued its<br>
        metamorphosis. His arrows of light<br>
        have become so powerful that he<br>
        can only be the dragon of legend.<br>
        I only hope that his heart hasn't<br>
        changed, because Lagi is all that I have left.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">(3/3) The dark dragon appeared again. The first time we 
        met, it shot Lagi down inside the village. We have encountered it again 
        since<br>
        then, but the dragon has not attacked. Is it chasing the airship as well?<br>
        <br>
        3rd day of 12th month </font></p>
      <p><font size="4">(1/3) How could I ever describe today? Sinking the airship 
        at Georgius. The final battle with the dark dragon, and killing the<br>
        abomination it fused with. And then there was the vision Lagi<br>
        showed me before he left.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="4">(2/3) Losing Lagi has left me numb, and the vision has 
        left me<br>
        overwhelmed. When he destroyed<br>
        the ship, he entrusted me with his secret. The secret of him, and of the 
        world.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">3/3 Already, the understanding I<br>
        gained is slipping from my grasp.<br>
        It's like waking from a dream... The experience has left my heart uneasy, 
        I feel as if there's now something missing.<br>
        <br>
        6th day of 12th month </font></p>
      <p><font size="4">(1/3) I found the ancient airship wreck. Inside, it was 
        as quiet as it was dead. What remaining monsters were left had long since 
        died. Lagi's final act sealed the life from the airship forever.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="4">(2/3) In the center of the airship,<br>
        Lagi laid still, his power completely exhausted. Lagi's body was stone 
        cold, but I knew he was still alive. At least, deep inside of me, I believed 
        so'</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">(3/3) One day, Lagi will regain his<br>
        power and return to the sky. And<br>
        there will be another rider...<br>
        Someone other than me. But I won't be sad. As long as I do not lose what 
        Lagi entrusted to me, he shall always be with me.</font></p>

      <p><font size="4">(6/8) At this time, the knowledge of the Gods was used 
        to create weapons. The Gods' fire burned the earth, the Gods' tools ended 
        life, and the monsters were taught to devour human flesh.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="4">(7/8) At the Dusk of Genesis,<br>
        the Gods lost all hope for the<br>
        people. The Gods left the human<br>
        world. As did the Gods' knowledge. The humans were left behind without 
        the ability to create, but still had the power to destroy. </font></p>
      <p><font size="4">(8/8) Water, plants, and beasts<br>
        disappeared, the ruins closed<br>
        their doors, only the monsters<br>
        remained to feed. And thus,<br>
        the Gods have left the humans.<br>
        We were a part of the Gods' glory,<br>

      <p><font size="4">(1/2) The main weapon of the dragon is lightning shot 
        from its mouth. Its lightning has the odd trait of bending towards its 
        target. There are also reports of homing bullets and waves of living particles, 
        but it's all hearsay.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="4">(2/2) The dragon's powers exceed any weapon we now possess. 
        The Academy calculates that the dragon has the potential firepower of 
        at least fifty gunships.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="4">The Dragon Rider<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="4">(1/2) The most notable report about the dragon is that 
        there was a rider on its back. Besides a few lesser monsters, such as 
        Coolias,<br>
        no creatures exhibit fond behavior towards humans. </font></p>
      <p><font size="4">(2/2) The identity of this rider remains a mystery, but 
        his amazing<br>
        reactions and advanced combat<br>
        skills indicate he's not human.<br>
        Thus the Academy has theorized<br>
        that he is a human-shaped creation, similar to the monsters.<br>

      <p><font size="4">The Dragon and the 'Tower'<br>

        split between the theories that the dragon is the Guardian of the Tower 
        or that it is the destroyer of the Tower. </font></p>
      <p><font size="4">(2/2) On Imperial Year 89, while the Empire attempted 
        to reactivate a Tower, two dragons appeared, and acted in completely opposite<br>
        manners. This created even more<br>

        good depends on the completion of your Mission. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="4">How to Handle Ancient Weapons<br>
        (1/2) At the Academy, research is being done, day and night, to unlock 
        the mysteries of the ancients. It will not be long before the Empire can 
        produce engines and other devices on our own. </font></p>
      <p><font size="4">(2/2) Because the weapons our forces use are repaired 
        and modified relics from the past, there are always shortages. Special 
        caution must be used in handling them, and our first priority must be 
        to hold the consumption of power to a minimum.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="4">Battle Against the Monsters<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="4">(1/3) The uncivilized people of the<br>
        frontier cannot harm our forces.<br>
        The real threat is the enemy that<br>
        wields the power of the ancient<br>
        ones, the monsters. They are<br>
        extremely dangerous. An ordinary<br>
        man is but food to them.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="4">(2/3) Monsters are unintelligent. The Academy is very 
        close to<br>
        understanding their instincts. Our<br>
        weapons, formations, and tactics<br>
        are based upon this research. Use<br>
        them wisely, and the Empire will<br>
        triumph.<br>

      <p><font size="4">(3/3) Cadets, you are expected to give total obedience 
        to your superiors and to perform all of your duties. Your devotion to 
        the Empire will allow you to defeat any enemies, and they will tremble 
        before you. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="4">How to Deal with Seekers<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="4">(1/2) Among the tribes in the frontier, there exists a 
        clan whose sole purpose is to steal relics from<br>
        the ruins, stealing from your Emperor. These 'seekers' are a blight on 
        the Empire, and they<br>
        must be killed on sight. </font></p>
      <p><font size="4">(2/2) The seekers are poorly organized, and are equipped 
        only with hunter's weapons, so they pose little military threat. But in<br>
        many cases, they carry ancient relics, so it is advised to avoid<br>
        the use of heavy weaponry.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="4">Quest for the Tower<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="4">(1/2) Our main goal is to acquire<br>
        the power of the ultimate weapon<br>
        of the ancients, the 'Towers'.<br>
        Imperial Legends state that each Tower contains enough destructive force 
        to destroy the entire world. </font></p>
      <p><font size="4">(2/2) Weapons of such power must be handled by the rightful 
        heir of<br>
        the ancient civilization, his highness. That is the path of world order, 
        and that is why we exist.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="4">To Capture a Dragon<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="4">(1/2) In the frontier, the dragons are worshipped as Messengers 
        of the Gods, but that is a groundless<br>
        superstition. The dragons are, in<br>
        fact, nothing more than monsters<br>
        with an arsenal of destructive powers. Don't underestimate them. </font></p>
      <p><font size="4">(2/2) Though dragons may appear simply as powerful monsters, 
        it is<br>
        thought that they are somehow<br>
        related to the Towers. To solve<br>
        the mysteries surrounding the<br>
        Towers, we must capture a dragon,<br>
        at all costs.</font></p></td>

        <p align="left"><font size="5"><font size="4">(1/4) Imperial Age 71, 10th 
          day of 6th month. A scout team inside<br>

          monsters and battleships. </font></font></p>

          obliterating it with a lightning attack. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4">(4/4) The reason of the lightning attack 
          remains a mystery, but the village had a Coolia breeding farm. One theory

          was put on hold. Its location was<br>
          lost, so our forces were placed in<br>
          the forest area, on the Shelcoof's<br>
          expected flight course, and there,<br>
          they waited. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4">(2/5) Above the forest, a new type of monster 
          was sighted. Its shape<br>
          did not fit any known monsters,<br>

          </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4">(3/5) But before we could report the new 
          creature, Shelcoof was sighted. In a flash, it completely destroyed 
          our battle squadron. Despite being only one vessel, its overwhelming 
          power decimated every single one of our ships in minutes. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4">(4/5) Reports from the survivors<br>
          indicated that the second squadron<br>
          encountered Shelcoof near Georgius. They attempted to<br>

          with a lightning weapon. They were totally annihilated.<br>
          </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4">(5/5) There was a report that the lone

          his description of the dragon varied considerably from earlier reports. 
          Speculation was that he officer was hallucinating. <br>

        </font></p>
      <p><font size="4">(1/3) From the old sayings in Zoah,<br>
        there is an expression that a 'pair of wings' supports Mel-Kava. In other 
        words, Mel-Kava uses a pair of engines to fly. </font></p>
      <p><font size="4">(2/3) To shoot down Mel-Kava you must destroy these engines, 
        but the path is blocked by 'the crawling guardians'. The name is from 
        an old legend, they might not exist, but be wary.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="4">(3/3) Legends say that Mel-Kava is<br>
        nearly invincible. It is surrounded by winged monsters and it is crawling 
        with monsters on the inside. Legends say that the destruction of Mel-Kava 
        lies within. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="4">Light Particle(1/3) Mel-Kava emits energy particles. My 
        recording device's orbiter was destroyed as soon as it touched an energy 
        particle. Even a dragon, struck directly by a particle, would surely be 
        blown away. </font></p>
      <p><font size="4">(2/3) Your best hope would be to destroy the exhaust ports. 
        Atop Mel-Kava are dozens of them. If you destroy them all, the ship may<br>
        become unstable.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="4">(3/3) If you cannot stop the particles, you must somehow

      <p><font size="4">(2/4) It was through reactivating an<br>
        Information Structure that we were<br>
        able to discover the existence of the Towers. We also found out<br>
        these structures also contain important functions other than<br>
        simply recording information.</font></p>

        field that can control monsters' actions. It was built, perhaps, to guard 
        the information recorded there. But the power source is very small, so 
        it is probably severely limited.<br>

        <br>
        Birth of Dragon(1/3) This world has been molded into its current shape 
        by the powers of a series of ruins we call Towers. The Towers control 
        the environment, breed monsters, and control human populations.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="4">(2/3) Even in the Ancient Age, there were people against 
        the presence of the Towers. The Towers' creators feared these rebels would 
        rise to destroy the Towers, so they created monsters to guard their creations. 
        And the dragons.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">(3/3) One dragon is posted at each<br>
        Tower. They perform their duty to<br>
        this day, as they have for over a<br>
        millenium. Not even the Empire can stand before them. The only force that 
        can counter the dragon's<br>
        power are the dragons themselves.<br>
        <br>
        Birth of Dragon(1/4) The dragon you ride has inherited the soul of my 
        old friend. Your dragon is the only dragon in this world which exists 
        to 'kill the Towers'. You will be forced to battle other dragons.<br>
        They are all your enemies.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="4">(2/4) My friend, the heresy dragon, had a birth which 
        was equally heretic. My friend was born as a mutant Coolia, and was raised 
        in my care. That was until the floating<br>
        Tower appeared, and he gained the<br>
        power of the dragon.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">(3/4) I have no idea why my friend had such a humble beginning. 
        Perhaps it was pure coincidence that he spent his youth in my care. But 
        he did choose me as the rider.<br>
        The Tower took everything, I was<br>
        left desiring only his power.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="4">(4/4) By destroying the Tower of the Sky, Shelcoof, our 
        journey came to an end. Exhausting all his power, he discarded his body, 
        and entered a deep sleep. I assume he has now reemerged with a new body, 
        and chosen you as his rider.<br>
        To the New Rider</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">1/2 I believe my friend is trying to<br>
        lead you to the Tower. You will<br>
        become deeply involved with his<br>
        purpose, the destruction of the<br>
        Tower, for reasons beyond your<br>
        comprehension.<br>
        </font></p>

        purpose. It is<br>
        not only to release the world from<br>

        has cast itself upon us all.<br>

          </font></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4">(2/3) The data we've gathered has<br>
          indicated that this is, in fact, one of the ancient ultimate weapons, 
          a 'Tower'. By Imperial order, all excavation processes have ceased and 
          all efforts have shifted to reviving the Tower.<br>
          </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4">(3/3) To reawaken the Tower, engines from 
          the 2nd Regiment Battleships were removed and attached to breathe new 
          life into the Tower. After 12 full days, the Tower's status had not 
          changed. <br>

        <p align="left"><font size="4">(1/4) Once the Tower was successfully unearthed,

          investigation began. But the missing elements needed for<br>

        <p align="left"><font size="4">(2/4) What finally broke its stagnant state

          reaction.<br>
          </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4">(3/4) Soon after the Tower showed life,

          was hastily assembled near the<br>
          border and sent to capture the<br>
          rapidly approaching dragons. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4">(4/4) But the dragons were more powerful 
          than anything our forces had faced before. We even attempted to use 
          our prototype weapons, but the battle only resulted in the total annihilation 
          of our troops.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4">Tower Energy Report<br>
          </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4">(1/4) By the time the dragons approached 
          the Imperial Defense line, Headquarters had abandoned any plans of capturing 
          the dragons.<br>
          We gathered our remaining forces<br>
          to counterattack, but victory was<br>
          impossible against these demons. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4">(2/4) The two dragons broke through the 
          defense line, easily<br>
          reaching the Tower, and then they<br>
          began fighting. Suddenly, the<br>
          Tower's power output increased<br>
          dramatically.<br>
          </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4">(3/4) With the Tower's change, a massive 
          horde of monsters rose from the sea. Then the Tower's outer shell opened, 
          taking one of the dragons in. The Tower instantly became fully operational. 
          </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4">(4/4) Reports vary about what happened 
          next. The only fact is the Tower is gone. It was reported that<br>
          one of the dragons grew to a<br>
          colossal size and the ensuing<br>
          battle destroyed the Tower. But<br>
          there has been no confirmation.<br>

        <p align="left"><font size="4">Tower Defense Concept <br>
          </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4">(1/3) Due to the battle between the<br>
          dragons, attacks from the sea<br>
          monsters, and the destruction of<br>
          the Tower, most of the Imperial<br>
          Capital was destroyed. The loss<br>
          of life will mark this as one of<br>
          the darkest days in our history. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4">(2/3) Fortunately, the Palace and<br>
          Academy suffered only minimal<br>
          damage, but these events led to a<br>
          reexamination of our defense plan.<br>
          And, as a result, we have begun<br>
          building a large scale flagship,<br>

      <p><font size="4">(2/4) At the same time the Towers purify the air, water,

        </font></p>
