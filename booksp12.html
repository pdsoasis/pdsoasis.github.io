          Guide) - Regulation of Imperial Troops</font></strong></em><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5"><br>
          </font></font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(1/3) The uncivilized people of the<br>
          frontier fear the ancient machines and subject them to their idiotic 
          beliefs. Our duty is to locate the buried finds, and return them to 
          the rightful heir, his highness. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(2/3) We will use the power of the<br>
          ancient ones to cleanse the world<br>
          of the monsters and return humans<br>
          to their former glory. Expanding<br>
          the Empire, including securing as<br>
          many ruins and machines as possible, will achieve this goal.<br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(3/3) If anyone stands in your way,<br>
          eliminate them. They resist out of<br>
          ignorance. The Empire has a duty<br>
          to protect them. We fight not to invade, but to teach the truth. The 
          greater good depends on the completion of your Mission. <br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">How to Handle Ancient Weapons<br>
          (1/2) At the Academy, research is being done, day and night, to unlock 
          the mysteries of the ancients. It will not be long before the Empire 
          can produce engines and other devices on our own. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(2/2) Because the weapons our forces use are repaired 
          and modified relics from the past, there are always shortages. Special 
          caution must be used in handling them, and our first priority must be 
          to hold the consumption of power to a minimum.<br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">Battle Against the Monsters<br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(1/3) The uncivilized people of the<br>
          frontier cannot harm our forces.<br>
          The real threat is the enemy that<br>
          wields the power of the ancient<br>
          ones, the monsters. They are<br>
          extremely dangerous. An ordinary<br>
          man is but food to them.<br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(2/3) Monsters are unintelligent. The Academy is very 
          close to<br>
          understanding their instincts. Our<br>
          weapons, formations, and tactics<br>
          are based upon this research. Use<br>
          them wisely, and the Empire will<br>
          triumph.<br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(3/3) Cadets, you are expected to give total obedience 
          to your superiors and to perform all of your duties. Your devotion to 
          the Empire will allow you to defeat any enemies, and they will tremble 
          before you. <br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">How to Deal with Seekers<br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(1/2) Among the tribes in the frontier, there exists 
          a clan whose sole purpose is to steal relics from<br>
          the ruins, stealing from your Emperor. These 'seekers' are a blight 
          on the Empire, and they<br>
          must be killed on sight. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(2/2) The seekers are poorly organized, and are equipped 
          only with hunter's weapons, so they pose little military threat. But 
          in<br>
          many cases, they carry ancient relics, so it is advised to avoid<br>
          the use of heavy weaponry.<br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">Quest for the Tower<br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(1/2) Our main goal is to acquire<br>
          the power of the ultimate weapon<br>
          of the ancients, the 'Towers'.<br>
          Imperial Legends state that each Tower contains enough destructive force 
          to destroy the entire world. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(2/2) Weapons of such power must be handled by the rightful 
          heir of<br>
          the ancient civilization, his highness. That is the path of world order, 
          and that is why we exist.<br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">To Capture a Dragon<br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(1/2) In the frontier, the dragons are worshipped as 
          Messengers of the Gods, but that is a groundless<br>
          superstition. The dragons are, in<br>
          fact, nothing more than monsters<br>
          with an arsenal of destructive powers. Don't underestimate them. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(2/2) Though dragons may appear simply as powerful monsters, 
          it is<br>
          thought that they are somehow<br>
          related to the Towers. To solve<br>
          the mysteries surrounding the<br>
          Towers, we must capture a dragon,<br>
          at all costs.</font></p></td>
