          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5"><font size="4">(1/4) 
            Imperial Age 71, 10th day of 6th month. A scout team inside<br>
            Meccania territory, spotted a gigantic object flying towards the<br>
            border, surrounded by a horde of<br>
            monsters and battleships. </font></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(2/4) By Imperial Order 
            pursuit of the flying object (later named<br>
            'Shelcoof') ensued. But near the<br>
            rendezvous point with the scout<br>
            team, our forces clashed with the<br>
            Meccania Confederation Force,<br>
            delaying our recovery.<br>
            </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(3/4) Soon after the 
            Meccanian scum was dealt with, the scout team gave their report. Before 
            encountering our scout team, Shelcoof suddenly changed course, and 
            attacked a small village, obliterating it with a lightning attack. 
            </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(4/4) The reason of the 
            lightning attack remains a mystery, but the village had a Coolia breeding 
            farm. One theory is that the Coolias somehow drew the Shelcoof to 
            the village.<br>
            </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">Report on Missing Teams<br>
            </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(1/5) As a result of 
            the battle with<br>
            Meccania, the pursuit of Shelcoof<br>
            was put on hold. Its location was<br>
            lost, so our forces were placed in<br>
            the forest area, on the Shelcoof's<br>
            expected flight course, and there,<br>
            they waited. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(2/5) Above the forest, 
            a new type of monster was sighted. Its shape<br>
            did not fit any known monsters,<br>
            but its description matched the local legend of a 'dragon'.<br>
            </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(3/5) But before we could 
            report the new creature, Shelcoof was sighted. In a flash, it completely 
            destroyed our battle squadron. Despite being only one vessel, its 
            overwhelming power decimated every single one of our ships in minutes. 
            </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(4/5) Reports from the 
            survivors<br>
            indicated that the second squadron<br>
            encountered Shelcoof near Georgius. They attempted to<br>
            attack, but Shelcoof struck first<br>
            with a lightning weapon. They were totally annihilated.<br>
            </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(5/5) There was a report 
            that the lone surviving officer that the dragon was also sighted above 
            Georgius. But his description of the dragon varied considerably from 
            earlier reports. Speculation was that he officer was hallucinating. 
            <br>
            </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">Disappearance of Shelcoof<br>
            </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(1/2) Headquarters decided 
            that further troop losses would seriously<br>
            affect invasion plans of Meccania.<br>
            Plans to capture Shelcoof have<br>
            been postponed indefinitely. The<br>
            Meccania invasion was successful.<br>
            The Empire was victorious. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(2/2) Shelcoof became 
            the Empire's focus again, but it disappeared. All that was found was 
            a wreckage of something that may or may not have been Shelcoof. If 
            there was a force that could destroy Shelcoof, we would be afraid.</font></p>
