        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(1/3) If you are reading this, then 
          the seeker I sent has recognized you as the true dragon rider. I,too, 
          have met the dragon, and have since thrown myself into the struggle 
          over the Tower.<br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(2/3) My friend, the dragon, entrusted 
          me with the secret of his<br>
          existence before he left me. Later, I became a member of the seekers. 
          With the help of the Compilers, I tried to spread what I had learned 
          of the truth.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(3/3) What is written here is only part 
          of the secret that was entrusted to me. It may only be the tiniest bit 
          of knowledge, but I hope this will aid you in your quest. You, the new 
          dragon rider.<br>
          <br>
          Birth of Dragon(1/3) This world has been molded into its current shape 
          by the powers of a series of ruins we call Towers. The Towers control 
          the environment, breed monsters, and control human populations.<br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(2/3) Even in the Ancient Age, there 
          were people against the presence of the Towers. The Towers' creators 
          feared these rebels would rise to destroy the Towers, so they created 
          monsters to guard their creations. And the dragons.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(3/3) One dragon is posted at each<br>
          Tower. They perform their duty to<br>
          this day, as they have for over a<br>
          millenium. Not even the Empire can stand before them. The only force 
          that can counter the dragon's<br>
          power are the dragons themselves.<br>
          <br>
          Birth of Dragon(1/4) The dragon you ride has inherited the soul of my 
          old friend. Your dragon is the only dragon in this world which exists 
          to 'kill the Towers'. You will be forced to battle other dragons.<br>
          They are all your enemies.<br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(2/4) My friend, the heresy dragon, 
          had a birth which was equally heretic. My friend was born as a mutant 
          Coolia, and was raised in my care. That was until the floating<br>
          Tower appeared, and he gained the<br>
          power of the dragon.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(3/4) I have no idea why my friend had 
          such a humble beginning. Perhaps it was pure coincidence that he spent 
          his youth in my care. But he did choose me as the rider.<br>
          The Tower took everything, I was<br>
          left desiring only his power.<br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(4/4) By destroying the Tower of the 
          Sky, Shelcoof, our journey came to an end. Exhausting all his power, 
          he discarded his body, and entered a deep sleep. I assume he has now 
          reemerged with a new body, and chosen you as his rider.<br>
          To the New Rider</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">1/2 I believe my friend is trying to<br>
          lead you to the Tower. You will<br>
          become deeply involved with his<br>
          purpose, the destruction of the<br>
          Tower, for reasons beyond your<br>
          comprehension.<br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">2/2 I beg you to please aid my friend 
          in fulfilling his purpose. It is<br>
          not only to release the world from<br>
          the will of the ancients, but to shake the shadow of death, which<br>
          has cast itself upon us all.</font><font size="4"><br>
