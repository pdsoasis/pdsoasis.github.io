          (1/2) A week has past since we came to the excavation site, accepting 
          the Empire's commission. They are desperately trying to find something. 
          The director of this excavation site has been looking for over 20 years 
          already. Crazy. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(2/2) It appears that, once again, they have failed 
          to find whatever it is that they're looking for.<br>
          As always, we're left in the dark.<br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">25th day of 10th month</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(1/2) Thanks to that huge wind net,<br>
          there's no way a monster could get<br>
          in here. This job is probably going to be easier than I first thought.<br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(2/2) This evening, I talked with the director. Apparently, 
          only 'smart' folks can enter the Imperial<br>
          Academy. He said enrolling in a<br>
          normal school should be his first<br>
          priority. I'll talk to Edge.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4"><br>
          8th day of 11th month </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4"><br>
          (1/2) As always, nothing new at the<br>
          excavation site, all they've dug<br>
          up is ancient garbage. I talked with the director again. He says it'll 
          cost a lot of dynes just to enroll Edge in school. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(2/2) I'm worried that there's only a few good years 
          left in me and I<br>
          won't be able to earn enough money to pay for Edge's schooling.<br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">20th day of 12th month<br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(1/4) Why did I start writing this<br>
          diary? It's not like me at all. I guess it's because of him. How many 
          times have I told him that I think of him as my son? But I've never 
          done anything that a parent would do. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(2/4) Unlike me, barely literate, Edge is a smart kid. 
          I want him<br>
          to be enrolled in a school in the Empire. Being a mercenary in the middle 
          of nowhere is not a job for an innocent boy.<br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(3/4) After this job is done, I<br>
          plan to take him to the Capital. I want to do more than write in my<br>
          diary, I should start studying myself. I don't want him to be ashamed 
          of me when he grows up. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(4/4) Will Edge ever call me...<br>
          father?</font></p></td>
