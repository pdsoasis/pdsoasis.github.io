          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5"><font size="4">(1/3) 
            Imperial Age 89, 18th day of 2nd month. Very low traces of energy 
            were identified inside the ocean. An investigation has indicated that 
            we've discovered some ruins. By our calculations, it may exceed the 
            power of anything we've seen. </font></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(2/3) The data we've 
            gathered has<br>
            indicated that this is, in fact, one of the ancient ultimate weapons, 
            a 'Tower'. By Imperial order, all excavation processes have ceased 
            and all efforts have shifted to reviving the Tower.<br>
            </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(3/3) To reawaken the 
            Tower, engines from the 2nd Regiment Battleships were removed and 
            attached to breathe new life into the Tower. After 12 full days, the 
            Tower's status had not changed. <br>
            </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">Appearance of the Dragons<br>
            </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(1/4) Once the Tower 
            was successfully unearthed, a full scale<br>
            investigation began. But the missing elements needed for<br>
            reactivation eluded us. We<br>
            continued testing, but no apparent<br>
            reactions have been noticed. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(2/4) What finally broke 
            its stagnant state was something coming from the frontier. A pair 
            of dragons were seen approaching the Tower. We now believe they are 
            what triggered the Tower's reaction.<br>
            </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(3/4) Soon after the 
            Tower showed life, two dragons were sighted east of the Imperial Capital. 
            A squadron<br>
            was hastily assembled near the<br>
            border and sent to capture the<br>
            rapidly approaching dragons. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(4/4) But the dragons 
            were more powerful than anything our forces had faced before. We even 
            attempted to use our prototype weapons, but the battle only resulted 
            in the total annihilation of our troops.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">Tower Energy Report<br>
            </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(1/4) By the time the 
            dragons approached the Imperial Defense line, Headquarters had abandoned 
            any plans of capturing the dragons.<br>
            We gathered our remaining forces<br>
            to counterattack, but victory was<br>
            impossible against these demons. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(2/4) The two dragons 
            broke through the defense line, easily<br>
            reaching the Tower, and then they<br>
            began fighting. Suddenly, the<br>
            Tower's power output increased<br>
            dramatically.<br>
            </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(3/4) With the Tower's 
            change, a massive horde of monsters rose from the sea. Then the Tower's 
            outer shell opened, taking one of the dragons in. The Tower instantly 
            became fully operational. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(4/4) Reports vary about 
            what happened next. The only fact is the Tower is gone. It was reported 
            that<br>
            one of the dragons grew to a<br>
            colossal size and the ensuing<br>
            battle destroyed the Tower. But<br>
            there has been no confirmation.<br>
            </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">Tower Defense Concept 
            <br>
            </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(1/3) Due to the battle 
            between the<br>
            dragons, attacks from the sea<br>
            monsters, and the destruction of<br>
            the Tower, most of the Imperial<br>
            Capital was destroyed. The loss<br>
            of life will mark this as one of<br>
            the darkest days in our history. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(2/3) Fortunately, the 
            Palace and<br>
            Academy suffered only minimal<br>
            damage, but these events led to a<br>
            reexamination of our defense plan.<br>
            And, as a result, we have begun<br>
            building a large scale flagship,<br>
            'Grig Orig'.<br>
            </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(3/3) The Flagship Grig 
            Orig is a flying Fortress. When completed, not even a dragon could 
            penetrate its defenses and harm his highness.</font><font size="4">
