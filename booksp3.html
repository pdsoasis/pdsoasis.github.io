        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5"><br>

          (1/3) An envoy from Meccania came to purchase a grown Coolia. Meccanian 
          officers always pay well, so there was plenty of food on the table that 
          night. But I had to clean up the dead Coolia's remains, so I didn't 
          feel like eating. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(2/3) 'Destroy the mutants', it is the<br>
          village's code. The mutant Coolias cannot be tamed, and no one will 
          buy them. Besides, they are believed to be a bad omen.<br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(3/3) But to me, Coolias are all<br>
          the same. I can't believe that blue-<br>
          white light could bring our village harm. <br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">25th day of first month</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4"><br>
          (1/1) Loth became feverish. She was near delivery, so I had to take 
          care of her overnight. If I allowed her to die, I would be punished 
          for sure. It's not like I really could do<br>
          anything for her, they just needed a caretaker. My bad luck. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">26th day of first month<br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(1/2) Unfortunately, Loth passed away. 
          My father whipped me and sent me to bed hungry. But none of that mattered. 
          I lied about the baby. I told them it was stillborn, but it actually 
          was sleeping quietly in the barn. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(2/2) I didn't mean to break the code... 
          only, I couldn't kill him...<br>
          because Lagi had... a pair of wings!.<br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">27th day of first month<br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(1/2) I named the little Coolia 'Lagi'. 
          If anyone knew the reason why I decided to take care of him,<br>
          they would just laugh at me. All the legends and scriptures of our village 
          describe a dragon. And Lagi reminds me of that dragon. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(2/2) I know it's all childish dreaming, 
          but I want to see Lagi grow up. If he could actually fly...<br>
          I could be like the dragon rider in the fairy tales I was told in my 
          childhood.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4"><br>
          8th day of 9th month<br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(1/1) Lagi's growth rate is amazing. 
          At this rate, he could be as big as<br>
          a full-grown Coolia in a year. His wings are strengthening too. I took 
          him running today, and just for an instant, he actually floated. Lagi 
          may really fly! </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4"><br>
          19th day of 10th month</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4"><br>
          (1/3) Yesterday, my whole life ended. The home where I lived, everyone 
          in the village, they're gone. Dead. The airship appeared out of nowhere, 
          attacked without reason, and turned my village into nothing but ashes... 
          </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(2/3) Disaster struck while we were<br>
          outside the village, practicing.<br>
          Somehow, I couldn't even cry. The<br>
          village was in flames before me, yet I couldn't accept it. It was,<br>
          however, what Lagi did next that<br>
          sent shivers down my spine.<br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(3/3) What Lagi fired towards the<br>
          ancient airship... It was the legendary 'arrows of light'. My dream 
          had become a reality, but the villagers had paid for it with their souls.
