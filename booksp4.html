          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">23rd day of 10th month<br>
            </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(1/3) Three days have passed since weleft. 
            Some people in a caravan<br>
            were kind enough to share food andwater with us. They also told uswhat 
            they saw. They said the<br>
            ancient airship was heading for<br>
            the border, towards the Empire. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(2/3) Why do I follow that airship? To 
            be honest, I don't know...<br>
            Revenge? Well, perhaps at first...<br>
            But something more draws me to it.<br>
            </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(3/3) Revenge is not the only reason. 
            Ifeel as if I have a mission to fulfil. I just cannot allow the<br>
            ancient airship to reach its destination. As long as I have<br>
            Lagi's power, I must follow it. <br>
            </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">2nd day of 11th month</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4"><br>
            (1/4) We were ambushed near the border. They used ancient weapons. 
            The battle was completely different to anything I've experienced before. 
            Vehicles that resembled monsters flew in the sky and their weapons 
            blazed demonic flames. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(2/4) It was like being in the middle 
            of warring Gods, only the combatants were people. Even if the vehicles 
            were hell spawn, the riders were still human. But I had to protect 
            myself. I sent them all to fiery deaths. Without hesitation.<br>
            </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(3/4) While fighting, I felt as if I<br>
            became one with Lagi. There was no fear. I was filled only with a 
            sense of duty. Was it really my will, or was it the dragon<br>
            controlling me all along? </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(4/4) Lagi has developed another power. 
            After the battle, Lagi began<br>
            glowing. Then, suddenly, he shed<br>
            his skin. My only guess is this is how dragons grow.<br>
            </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">14th day of 11th month</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4"><br>
            (1/3) Above the forest, the Imperial<br>
            Fleet attacked us. It wasn't their<br>
            weapons, or even their sheer<br>
            numbers that frightened me. It was<br>
            that I would be forced to kill even more people. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(2/3) We escaped into the forest, but 
            the creature I saw feasting on the charred corpses in my village<br>
            waited for us there. Maybe the<br>
            beast is connected with the ship<br>
            somehow. I feel I am close.<br>
            </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(3/3) After killing the monster, I<br>
            entered an ancient ruin. Inside, hordes of hideous creatures<br>
            attacked us like a hungry storm. We found an immense underground lake. 
            Water may bring life, but here was only the smell of death. </font></p>
