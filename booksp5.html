          Book 3) - Diary of the Dragon Rider - 3</font></em></strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5"><br>
          </font></font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">16th day of 11th month</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4"><br>
          (1/3) I've spent two days in Georgius.That ancient airship has drawn 
          me further than I ever imagined. My old life is but a distant memory. 
          This crusade has left me lonely. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(2/3) Lagi's body has continued its<br>
          metamorphosis. His arrows of light<br>
          have become so powerful that he<br>
          can only be the dragon of legend.<br>
          I only hope that his heart hasn't<br>
          changed, because Lagi is all that I have left.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(3/3) The dark dragon appeared again. The first time 
          we met, it shot Lagi down inside the village. We have encountered it 
          again since<br>
          then, but the dragon has not attacked. Is it chasing the airship as 
          well?<br>
          <br>
          3rd day of 12th month </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(1/3) How could I ever describe today? Sinking the airship 
          at Georgius. The final battle with the dark dragon, and killing the<br>
          abomination it fused with. And then there was the vision Lagi<br>
          showed me before he left.<br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(2/3) Losing Lagi has left me numb, and the vision has 
          left me<br>
          overwhelmed. When he destroyed<br>
          the ship, he entrusted me with his secret. The secret of him, and of 
          the world.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">3/3 Already, the understanding I<br>
          gained is slipping from my grasp.<br>
          It's like waking from a dream... The experience has left my heart uneasy, 
          I feel as if there's now something missing.<br>
          <br>
          6th day of 12th month </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(1/3) I found the ancient airship wreck. Inside, it 
          was as quiet as it was dead. What remaining monsters were left had long 
          since died. Lagi's final act sealed the life from the airship forever.<br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(2/3) In the center of the airship,<br>
          Lagi laid still, his power completely exhausted. Lagi's body was stone 
          cold, but I knew he was still alive. At least, deep inside of me, I 
          believed so'</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(3/3) One day, Lagi will regain his<br>
          power and return to the sky. And<br>
          there will be another rider...<br>
          Someone other than me. But I won't be sad. As long as I do not lose 
          what Lagi entrusted to me, he shall always be with me.</font></p></td>
