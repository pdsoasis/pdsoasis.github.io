          1)- The Book of Genesis</font></em></strong></font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5"><br>
          <font size="4">(1/8) In the beginning, the world was with the Gods. 
          People basked in the Gods' glory. Everything was at peace. </font></font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(2/8) At the dawn of Genesis, the Gods created humans. 
          The Gods decided the humans would create their own world. To enable 
          such weak beings to complete such a task, all of the knowledge of the 
          Gods was placed into the souls of humans.<br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(3/8) During Genesis, people created the world. Using 
          Tools and Fire from the Gods, the humans built and shaped their own 
          world. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(4/8) Everything we see with our eyes, with one lone 
          exception, was<br>
          created in this time. Water, plants, and beasts, became provisions for 
          humans. The ruins were homes for Gods and humans. Monsters were servants 
          of people.<br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(5/8) At the Dusk of Genesis,<br>
          people began to fight one another.<br>
          From their fear of the darkness,<br>
          they were driven mad. From their<br>
          madness, they learned murder. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(6/8) At this time, the knowledge of the Gods was used 
          to create weapons. The Gods' fire burned the earth, the Gods' tools 
          ended life, and the monsters were taught to devour human flesh.<br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(7/8) At the Dusk of Genesis,<br>
          the Gods lost all hope for the<br>
          people. The Gods left the human<br>
          world. As did the Gods' knowledge. The humans were left behind without 
          the ability to create, but still had the power to destroy. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">(8/8) Water, plants, and beasts<br>
          disappeared, the ruins closed<br>
          their doors, only the monsters<br>
          remained to feed. And thus,<br>
          the Gods have left the humans.<br>
          We were a part of the Gods' glory,<br>
          but now there is only chaos.<br>
