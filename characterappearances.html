              are among the few domesticated creatures found in the Panzer Dragoon 
              world. Hunters use them to pull caravan carts and Seekers use them 
              as transportation across long distances, such as deserts. They can 
              be stubborn at times and hard to handle. Their main source of food 
              are Junio Seeds, not a good food for a Coolia.</font></p>

              Panzer Dragoon games, have been viewed as taboo. The village code 
              was to kill any young Coolia who was emitting a strange green light 
              from their throat. One of these baby Coolias survived and mutated 
              into the dragon, we see in all of the Panzer Dragoon games. They 
              are funny little creatures, always stumbling over things and appearing

            Coolia will tag along with him. This little Coolia acts as the comic 
            relief, throughout the explanation of each culture. He can be obnoxious, 
            clumsy, funny and down right crazy sometimes. Most of the time, he 
            just gets on the wise old Coolia's nerves but nevertheless, he is 
            curious to learn and hear what the wise old Coolia has to say.</font></p></td>
