            is controlled by the Empire. In Panzer Dragoon Saga, Craymen betrays 
            the Empire and goes renegade. Now branded as a traitor, with a mysterious 
            girl called Azel by his side, he seeks to form his own nation, attempting 
            to beat the Empire in the race for ultimate control over the ancient 
            technologies. He is ruthless and cunning. With his loyal fleet of 
            battleships, he will stop at nothing to reach his ambitious goal.</font></p>
