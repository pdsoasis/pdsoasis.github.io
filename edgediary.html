          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">After the tragic events which involved 
            the death of my friends, I was saved by a mysterious dragon. This 
            dragon became my friend.We flew into the sky, headed toward the Excavation 
            Site, hoping there would be any survivors. While we flew threw what 
            was called &quot;Above the Excavation Site,&quot; We came upon these 
            odd hanging boxes. Believe it or not, there were actually hidden items 
            in these hanging boxes. It only took the dragon multiple shots with 
            his laser, and the many items from these boxes were ours. We also 
            found various abandoned mine carts at Excavation Site # 4. I had the 
            dragon destroy them right away, as they were just Imperial peices 
            of crap. We gladly took the carts contents.</font></p>

            a laser at it, and a message played back. The crews last dying words,

            of Ancient Ruins and ongoing sand dunes. Gash called it the &quot;Garil 
            Desert.&quot; We flew under numerous ancient Arches. Suddenly, a red 
            worm erupted from the sand leading us to its secret lair, upon which 
            we found 3 Shield Chips.</font></p>

          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">During our travels in the Garil Desert, 
            we noticed some very exotic multicolored plants, found in the Green 
            Oasis and Blue Ruins. Gash told me they were called Kuo plants and 
            they contained a special pollen. This pollen would make my dragon 
            fly faster. I quickly had the dragon lock onto one of the white plants, 
            and we had ourselves some Kuo Pollen. The dragon's speed did indeed 
            improve, once he ate the exotic pollen (Note, while flying, holding 
            B, press L, let go of L, then let go of B. You will now be able to 
            fly without having to constantly hold down the B button!). </font></p>
