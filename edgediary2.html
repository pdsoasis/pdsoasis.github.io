        <p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="6">Eavesdropping on the 
          Citizens of Zoah</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="5">I made my way back to 
          the caravan after having returned from the Forbidden Zone. I went to 
          Fei's tent to see how she was doing. At first, she was cold towards 
          me, but as time went on and after talking to her many times, she bagan 
          to warm up to me and started to talk. She told me she was no longer 
          afraid of the outside world, because it was the same world I lived in. 
          I told her I had to leave soon, she said she would miss me. I think 
          she likes me. Night soon fell upon the caravan. I found Raul, in the 
          back working the night shift. He asked me to do him a favor. He gave 
          me an item called the Verato Pipe. He said if I found any survivors 
          from the village Verato, to please give the pipe to them. I agreed. 
          In the morning, I left for the Town of Zoah. There I was, at the great 
          Town of Zoah. Many things to do, many people to see. The first thing 
          I did was eavesdrop on the citizens conversations. If I saw two people 
          together talking, I would stand far away and listen to what they were 
          saying. It was a good way to see what was on the citizens minds.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><strong><font color="#000000" size="6">Jared the Shopkeeper's 
          Generosity </font></strong></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="5">While in Zoah, in the 
          Liberal District, I met the shopkeeper Jared. Upon examining his bookshelf, 
          he generosly let me keep some of his old books that he didn't want any 
          longer. The books he gave me consisted of: Dragon Book 1, Ship Report, 
          Bible 2, and Zoah Bible.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><strong><font color="#000000" size="6">Juba's Bar</font></strong></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="5">I found a girl named 
          Jeal, a waitress in the Liberal Districts bar. I gave her the Verato 
          Pipe Raul had given me, and she happily warmed up to me. Soon after, 
          I went upstairs to have a drink. The table to the left that I was sitting 
          at, had &quot;They killed Kenny,&quot; etched into its surface. I didn't 
          understand its meaning.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><strong><font color="#000000" size="6">Radgam's Quiz</font></strong></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="5">I visited an old hunter 
          called Radgam, in the Liberal District. I looked at his gun that he 
          had sitting on a pedestal. It was in some ways similar to mine. He told 
          me if I was to survive in the world, I should be knowledgable of the 
          many creatures that exist outside of Zoah. He asked me to take his hunter's 
          quiz, and I accepted. </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="5">He began by asking me, 
          what was a safe area when fighting a Baldor? I confidently told him, 
          it was the back.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="5"> Next, he asked me how 
          would I go about killing a Lathum? I told him you just have to find 
          its weak point. </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="5">Then, he asked how would 
          I make a Nanyd Swarm scatter. I said, &quot;just kill the Queen&quot;. 
          </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="5">His next question was, 
          &quot;What is a characteristic of a Lazara?&quot;I replied by saying, 
          &quot;They dodge lasers&quot;. </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="5">Then he asked, &quot;Which 
          do not live in the Valley?&quot; I looked at him straight in the eyes 
          and said, &quot;Hoppers&quot;. </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="5">Next he asked, &quot;What 
          is summoned by a Pluder?&quot; &quot;Nanyds&quot;, was my answer. </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="5">&quot;What is the Horned 
          Stryders attack&quot;, he replied. I told him, &quot;Paralyzing Shard 
          of course&quot;.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="5"> His final question was, 
          &quot;which is stronger Magnata or Gelata?&quot; My final answer was, 
          &quot;Magnata Urchins&quot;. </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="5">He told me I had done 
          a great job and gave me a Tri-Burst.</font></p>

        <p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="5">During my Long day in 
          the Liberal District, I met a man named Abner. While in his house he 
          asked me if he could borrow 100 Dynes. I told him it was ok, as long 
          as he would pay me back. He said, &quot;no problem.&quot;</font></p>

        <p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="5">While walking around 
          the Liberal District, I stumbled upon an unusual well. I decided to 
          climb down it, and found a boy named Bezer. Bezer told me not to tell 
          anyone of his secret hiding spot and he gave me an Amirkhan Ring. </font></p>

        I went out back to go see Raul. I told him that I had found a survivor 
        from Verato Village, and that I had given her the pipe. He said he was 
        happy someone had survived, and told me a sad story about his destroyed 
        village. He gave me 1,000 Dynes as thanks. I said good-bye to Fei and 
        gave her the Amirkhan Ring, I received from Bezer. She happily gave me 
        a Palmer Amulet in return. I could see she was starting to become attached 
        to me.<strong><br>
