          Town of Zoah</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="5">After my long and endless battles, I 
          decided I needed to return to Zoah, to have a couple of Juba's illuminating 
          drinks. Jeal told me as thanks for giving her the Verato Pipe, she had 
          made it possible to have a discount on my drinks. I only had to pay 
          10 Dynes rather than 20.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="6"><strong>Jephthah the Seeker</strong></font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="5">After my drink, I went upstairs and found 
          the Seeker Jephthah. He tried to sell me a Tri-Burst. I asked him to 
          bring the price down. 1,000 Dynes was a steep price for a Tri-Burst. 
          His last offer was 800 Dynes and I gratiously excepted.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="6"><strong>Quitor and his Daughter Rhoda</strong></font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="5">After my visit at the bar, I walked myself 
          over to the Holy District. I met a man named Quitor, and his daughter 
          Rhoda. Quitor sold me Zaal nuts for a low price, and I sold him a Macran 
          Jewl . His daughter Rhoda gave me a mysterious music box called the 
          Aronak Unit (Note, you must have a Panzer Dragoon 2 Zwei save file on 
          your Saturn's internal memory, in order to recieve this item). It played 
          familiar melodies from another time and another place.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="6"><strong>Abner's Confession </strong></font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="5">After talking to Vaimen, I decided it 
          was time to get my 100 Dynes back from Abner. I stumbled upon him in 
          the Liberal District. He confessed to me that he wouldn't be able to 
          pay me back. He told me to go to his house and take whatever I wanted 
          from his junk pile. I agreed, and took Dragon book 2 from his junk stash. 
          </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="6"><strong>Paet's Room</strong></font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="5">My next stop was to check how Paet was 
          doing. After a long conversation about my travels, he told me I could 
          come by his house at night. Night soon arrived. Anxiously wanting to 
          see Paet's room, I ran all the way down a side alley, to the left of 
          Vaimens house. Paet let down his ladder, and I found myself in the great 
          inventors room. His room was full of ancient technological junk. He 
          gave me an old book called Dragon Book 3.</font></p>

        once more, to see how Enkak and An'jou were doing, only to find Enkak 
        had come down with Mechannia Fever and An'jou had left to find the cure. 
        The people from the caravan explained to me that a Tobitama Rock was the 
        only thing that would cure this deadly fever. After hearing this, I knew 
        I had to help An'jou find the cure, as two people searching for the Tobitama 
        Rock was better than just one. At Uru, after having returned the three 
        baby Tobitamas to their mother, the group of them abandoned their nest. 
        I found the infamous Tobitama Rock, within this nest. I gave this to Biacah 
        and he made an antidote for Enkak. Enkak soon began to steadily recover, 
        and everyting at the caravan gradualy began to return to normal.</font></p></td>

          death. Upon examining his body, I found his unloaded gun. I took the 
          gun back to Aldo's place, in the Liberal District. He couldn't believe

        to places of beauty. I just had to return to Uru, as it was a place of 
        unimaginable beauty. This soon got me into some trouble. The dragon and 
        I had to face a formidable and quite rare creature, called the Kolba. 
        After this battle, I returned to the underground labs of Uru one last 
        time. It was here on B3F, that I faced another rare creature called the 
        Absorborac. After the Absorborac battle, the dragon and I did a little 
        more exploring in this mysterious place. We found a secret level called 
        B?F, that we stumbled upon when falling down a hole near the Prototype 
        dragons, in B2F East, to the far North. Throughout the winding corridors, 
        we found an assortment of useful items.<br>

          to Georgius to lay the ancient ship Shellcoof to rest. With a laser 
          rank of #4, we activated all of the pyramid relics, one by one. This 
          allowed us access to the inner corridors of Shellcoof. Once inside, 
          a ghost of a dragon appeared, and lead us to a room with a dragon crest, 
          similar to the one in the ruins where I first met the dragon. I examined 
          the crest only to be blinded by a massive flash of light. A dragon pup 
          had emerged from the crest. The dragon said to me, &quot;This is my 
          true spirit, the spirit of Lagi.&quot; The dragon pup followed us whereever 
          we went from that point on. I took the crest with us for safe keeping.</font></p>

          needed inside Shellcoof, it was time to lay the ancient ship to rest. 
          We began to destroy the outter engine rudders of the massive ship, and 
          it soon began to deteriorate. With one final attempt to protect itself, 
          Shellcoof began to grab us with a series of laser beams. The dragon 
          easily destroyed the laser beams, and the ship fell to its watery grave.</font></p>
