          His laser rank was now at level 6, so we went back to the Garil Desert 
          to try and destroy the ancient ship that was buried in the sand. The 
          dragon succeeded, and we acquired an ancient technique called &quot;Plasma 
          Swarm.&quot; After that, we decided to return to Excavation site # 4, 
          to have ourselves a little fun. To test out the dragon's new laser level, 
          we destroyed all of the gigantic fans. It was a blast! Strangely we 
          also received items from these fans.</font></p>

          An'jou had also returned from his fruitless journey, he had failed in 
          his attempt to find an antidote for his son's illness. To his surprise, 
          he returned to find his son had completely recovered, thanks to me. 
          He gave me a Berserk Vampire to show his thanks, for saving his sons

          we returned to the Forest of Zoah, and discovered a Villatuya plant. 
          It looked similar to the Kuo plants, we had found in the Garil Desert. 
          The plant was found to the far north. It was bright blue and gave off 
          a strange yellow fruit. The dragon ate this fruit right away, and while 
          performing a role, his speed increased to an even greater extent (Note:while 
          flying, press the R button to do a roll, doing so will allow the dragon 
          to reach an even greater level of speed).</font></p>

        <p><font color="#000000" size="5">After getting the Villatuya fruit, we 
          were ambushed by creatures called Golia Hunters, and Golia Trackers. 
          The Golia Tracker attacked us while flying near the 3 Naga Cocoons, 
          found around the lower portion of the area. The Golia Hunter attacked 
          us while flying past a little patch of vegetation located to the center 
          of the 3 cocoon tunnels. These creatures nearly took our lives and I'm 
          glad to be standing here today, to tell my story. </font></p>

        Dragon's Transformation into Solowing </font> 
        <p><font size="5">Upon exploring the Red Ruins, found within the forest 
          of Zoah, we activated four rotating artifacts surrounding a gigantic 
          central shrine, that in turn, opened corresponding doors. We first entered 
          the shrine's southern door, to find a white relic. We proceeded to destroy 
          it. Next, we entered the shrine's eastern door, and destroyed another 
          white relic. Destroying this relic caused a giant, central, white ruin, 
          to rise upward. We passed through this ruin only to find it brought 
          us to the Garil Desert, at night. The desert was silent and peaceful. 
          There was nothing more to see, so we went back to the Red Ruins. This 
          time, we explored the northwestern chamber. Found within this chamber, 
          was an empty pedestal. I placed the Dragon Crest we had received from 
          inside Shellcoof on this pedestal, and to my amazement, the baby dragon 
          pup merged with the crest and my dragon! This turned my dragon into 
          the legendary blue dragon, Solowing! My dragon's voice echoed, &quot;Now 
          my soul is complete, my name is Lagi.&quot;</font></p>
