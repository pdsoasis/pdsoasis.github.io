            Emulator Setup:</font></strong></font></p>
          <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5">Go to <a href="https://www.retroarch.com" target="_blank">https://www.retroarch.com</a> 
            site and choose which device you want to install the emulator for. 
            Once you have RetroArch installed you will need to put the bios files 
            in the system folder found in your RetroArch main installation folder. 
            Although, you&#8217;ll have to find the Bios files yourself, if you 
            do a google search there is a pack on <a href="http://archive.org" target="_blank">http://archive.org</a></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5">Once you have the emulator 
            installed go to main menu and select the &quot;Online Updater&quot;. 
            Update everything in here.&nbsp; Then in RetroArch settings go to 
            settings: Video/Scaling/Aspect Ratio/and set the aspect ratio to 16:9.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5">Next you will need to 
            download the Sega Saturn cores. A core is the emulator itself of which 
            you install within the Retroarch user interface. You will have a choice 
            between 4 different Saturn emulators or cores. Go to main menu and 
            select download core and select the Sega Saturn Kronos core.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5">As of 12/26/23 the Kronos 
            core has been completely fixed. The issues with having a black screen 
            and missing text have all been resolved. For the Kronos core to work 
            properly make sure the main RetroArch installation is updated to 1.16.0 
            and if the Kronos core had been installed previously make sure to 
            update that as well.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5"><strong>Note</strong>: 
            the only Saturn core that works 100% in RetroArch as of now is the 
            Kronos Core. The other cores like Yabause might have slight issues 
            that impair their use. But if you want to use Yabause or Mednafen 
            as standalone emulators, separate from RetroArch, they work fairly 
            well. For more information on those standalone emulators see their 
            respective sections further down in this guide.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5"><strong>Note</strong>: 
            (<strong>This is very important</strong>) For a game with multiple 
            discs like Panzer Dragoon Saga and all single games as well, make 
            sure you test out each individual game file in Retroarch Kronos, by 
            itself, to see if it works properly before playing. Concerning a game 
            with multiple discs, If one of the discs/iso are corrupted when you 
            go to switch discs, the disc won't load and you will just be stuck 
            in the Saturn internal menu. As long as each individual disc works 
            you will be fine. RetroArch Kronos will load any .cue file of a game 
            but it has to have the .bin file to go along with it or the game won't 
            load at all.</font></p>
          <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="6">Setup for multiple discs:</font></p>
          <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5">Once your Sega Saturn 
            Kronos core is downloaded and you've tested and verified that each 
            individual game iso works, you need to set up your game files for 
            multiple discs. If you have no multiple disc games or don't intent 
            to play any, you can skip this step. Assuming you do, the instructions 
            are as follows: RetroArch will scan and play any .cue file of a specific 
            game. Again just make sure to have the .bin file to go along with 
            it. For a multi disc games like Panzer Dragoon Saga you need to go 
            through an additional step. You need to set up a .m3u text document 
            containing all of your game files. Each game multi disc or not, should 
            have its own separate folder. So concerning a multiple disc game like 
            Panzer Dragoon Saga, make a folder and put all 4 iso .cue and all 
            4 .bin files into it. Once everything is in one folder and organized 
            we need to make the m3u file. So, open up notebook or notebook++ and 
            copy the name of each of your .cue game files exactly, for each disc 
            as shown bellow and in the visual guide.</font></p>

            1 of 4) (NTSC).cue</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5">Panzer Dragoon Saga (Disc

          <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5">Then go to file and save 
            as. You can save this file whatever you want so I saved mine as: Panzer 
            Dragoon Saga.m3u. But the ending extension is very important and it 
            needs to be .m3u</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5"><strong>NOTE</strong>: 
            If you can't see the .txt extension at the end of your text document 
            title you need to change your settings to show known file extensions. 
            In Windows 10 it's very simple, you can find that on your folder under 
            'View' and a checkbox reading 'File name extensions'.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5">Once you create this 
            file put it in the same directory as your game files. Then when in 
            Retroarch use this file to load your game. Go to main menu/load content 
            and select your game folder location and load that m3u file. Your 
            game should boot up and you can select which core you want to use. 
            I suggest the Kronos core as you can upscale the graphics.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5">When you actually have 
            to switch discs you will need to press F1 and go into the quick menu 
            and perform these steps:</font></p>
          <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5">Play until the &quot;Please 
            insert disc 2&quot; prompt.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5">Quick Menu &gt; Disc 
            Control &gt; Eject Disc.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5">QUICK MENU &gt; RESUME, 
            just for a second.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5">Quick Menu &gt; Disc 
            Control &gt; Current Disc Index, change for disc 2.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5">And finally: Insert Disc.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5"><strong>Note</strong>: 
            After you switch discs, within the Saturn menu, the button on the 
            upper left will change to a curved &quot;S&quot;. You can then select 
            it to start the disc up.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5">For all other single 
            disc games you can just go to main menu/load content and just load 
            the .cue game file as is. Just make sure the .bin file is in the same 
            folder as the .cue game file.</font></p>
          <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="6"><strong>Kronos Game Settings:</strong></font></p>
          <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5">While a game is running 
            if you press F1 you will be presented with a number of emulator options. 
            Unlike Mednafen, Kronos actually upscales the game all the way up 
            to 8K resolution! Within this options menu, you can fine tune your 
            graphics settings or make any save states. For the Kronos Sega Saturn 
            core I suggest these settings:</font></p>
          <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5">SH-2 cpu core: Kronos 
            (&quot;Old&quot; setting not supported any longer.)</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5">Resolution: 1080p or 
            720p (If you experience slowdown stick with 720p.)</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5">Polygon Mode: gpu-tesselation</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5">Improved Mesh: on</font></p>

          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5">While a game is running 
            press F1 to go into the menu and select &quot;Save State&quot;. <strong>Note</strong>: 
            this feature was recently fixed, so be sure before starting the game 
            you &quot;update installed cores&quot; with the &quot;Online Updater&quot; 
            found in the main RetroArch menu.</font></p>
