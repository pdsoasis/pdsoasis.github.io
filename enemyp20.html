            at the Valley when I saved Gash, but not this close and personal! 
            I found him at the back of the caravan minding his own business eating 
            Junio Seeds, not a good food for a Coolia. He was quite domesticated. 
            Coolias pulled carts whenever the caravan had to travel. I think he 
            was scared of me, because he stopped eating and seemed disturbed. 
            It was later on, that he finally warmed up to me and wasn't so apprehensive.</font></p>
