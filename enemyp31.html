          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">The Protect Keys had come to life, 
            revealing the Guardians of Uru. The dragon sensing immediate danger, 
            changed into his Spiritual form. The guardian began the battle by 
            charging up an electrical attack which it then shot into the sky. 
            The attack came down upon us like a thunderstorm. This greatly weakened 
            the dragon. To prevent this attack from taking any more damage again, 
            the dragon used his Vengeance Orbs berserk attack. This attack surrounded 
            the dragon with protective orbs that shielded us from any one attack. 
            We noticed the guardian had two port engines on its left and right 
            sides, keeping it afloat. We flew to the left side of the guardian 
            and took out the first engine with lock-on lasers. The guardian then 
            attacked us with its thunderstorm attack once more. Its attack was 
            of no use, as my dragon's Vengeance Orbs repelled the attack and each 
            orb surrounding us shot outward, striking multiple targets on the 
            guardians body. This was a very good defensive technique. Once the 
            first engine was destroyed, we moved to the right side, taking out 
            the second engine with yet another stream of lock-on lasers. We had 
            taken critical damage to the guardian. A smaller guardian which was 
            connected to the larger one, now had to separate and become a separate 
            unit. The larger guardian now lay lifeless, leaving its rear open 
            for attack. We flew directly behind the helpless guardian and sent 
            a Judgment Day berserk attack at its vulnerable areas. I made sure 
            to recharge the dragon's berserk energy when needed, with Berserk 
            Medis items. The smaller guardian was hovering above us, just waiting 
            for an opportunity to attack. It soon did just that and sent an eye 
            beam which it swung from left to right. This attack landed on the 
            dragon and completely stopped his movement. As the dragon and I lay 
            helpless, unable to move, the flying guardian sent lightning needles 
            at us. These lightning needles encased us, hovering around the dragon's 
            body. We had to think fast or else we would be trapped inside, wide 
            open for the enemy to attack us. Luckily, I brought along items called 
            Free Actions. These items had the ability to free us from our stopped 
            movement. Once the dragon gained his mobility back, we quickly flew 
            out of the encasement of lightning needles. The flying guardian, just 
            as we moved out of the way, sent a thunderstrike beam, that flew within 
            the lightning needles. It just missed us! Without a target, the needles 
            fell into the water. We moved back behind the larger guardian and 
            sent another Judgment Day berserk attack at its weak spots. The flying 
            guardian shot another eye beam, hitting the dragon again with its 
            immobilizing abilities. I just used another Free Action item and the 
            dragon was free to move once more. We flew to the side as the hovering 
            guardian shot out its lightning needles, followed by its thunderstrike 
            beam, which missed its target once more. We made it our priority to 
            keep attacking the stationary larger guardians vulnerable spots, with 
            Judgment Day. Its system soon overloaded, causing the two to finally 
            be destroyed.</font></p>

          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">After confirming the last Protect 
            Key at the Black Ruins, we attempted to fly into the portal it opened. 
            Before we could enter the portal we were attacked by that girl and 
            her dragon yet again. Upon engaging the girl and her black dragon 
            in battle, my dragon changed into his Spiritual form. Hovering over 
            the black dragon, were many different orbs. My dragon immediately 
            flew in front of them and used his newly learned Armageddon berserk 
            attack. The orbs blew apart descending to the watery depths below. 
            The black dragon soon attacked us with its laser fire. It was time 
            to take some serious damage to its weak spot, located to its rear. 
            My dragon, in an attempt to boost up his laser power as much as possible 
            for his upcoming attack, changed into his Attack form. Soon after, 
            the girl yelled &quot;Ne-Rai.&quot; We knew what that meant from our 
            last encounter with her. We quickly flew to the front of the black 
            dragon as its rage of berserk lasers flew throughout the sky. After 
            the coast was clear, we flew to the black dragon's rear and my dragon 
            fired multiple lock-on lasers at its tail. We did this continually 
            taking a massive amount of damage. Just as we were getting close to 
            defeating the duo, the black dragon shot an unavoidable lightning 
            storm, hitting my dragon with pin point accuracy. My dragon was fatally 
            injured. With his last ounce of energy, my dragon fired another array 
            of lock-on lasers, taking out the black dragon once more.</font></p>
