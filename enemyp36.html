            they immediately flew around us, wanting us to bring them back to 
            their mother. They were fairly large for being baby Tobitamas. These 
            strange creatures had one eye, a set of wings and a long protruding 
            tail, with a large ball at the end. They happily flew to their mothers 
            side, once we found the Tobitama nest.</font></p>

          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">The giant Tobitama mother was fairly 
            odd as well. Two giant ears stretched off of its head. It, too had 
            one giant eye and a long protruding tail with a ball at its end. Long 
            claws could also be seen at the bottom of its body. The long ears 
            of the mother Tobitama were also its wings. When we returned the 3 
            Baby Tobitamas to the nest, they all flew away and abandoned it. They 
            left behind a rock-like secretion called a Tobitama Rock. This rock 
            can be made into an antidote to cure Meccania fever.</font></p>
