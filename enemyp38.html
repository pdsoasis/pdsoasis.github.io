            Zoah, I found another Coolia prancing around. Compared to the Coolias 
            at the caravan, who had dark brown skin and giant nostrils, this Coolia 
            looked more reptile-like. It had gray scaly skin and dark black eyes. 
            I had no idea there were different types of Coolias, until now. I 
            assumed it must have been Aldo's or Radgam's Coolia, since they were 
            both hunters. It was very well trained and domesticated.</font></p>
