          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">After destroying ten ships among the 
            Empires' Anchored Fleet, we were attacked by a gigantic battlestation. 
            The dragon, while in his Spiritual form, moved directly in front of 
            the massive hunk of ancient technology and constantly used his Armageddon 
            berserk attack. Between each attack, we were hit hard by Missiles 
            and Plague Rockets. After many Armageddon attacks, we had finally 
            caused the engine to blow and it descended to the water below. The 
            battlestation soon restored partial engine power, and began moving 
            along the surface of the water. As it moved towards us, I overheard 
            one of the Imperial officers utter something about a &quot;Disintegrator&quot; 
            weapon, that was being charged. I also noticed a vulnerable spot within 
            the center of the gigantic machine. To protect ourselves from this 
            &quot;Disintegrator&quot;, I immediately had the dragon cast his Astral 
            Phantoms defensive attack. The dragon also changed into his Attack 
            form so he could bombard the vulnerable spot with his powerful lock-on 
            lasers. The machine completely opened up, preparing to fire the Disintegrator. 
            At this point in the battle, the vulnerable spot was fully revealed 
            and open to attack. When the dragon's laser power was charged, he 
            fired his lock-on lasers upon the central weak point, taking heavy 
            damage. Soon after, the Disintegrator weapon was fired and a deadly 
            rain of lasers fell down upon us. It took not an ounce of damage and 
            was immediately deflected, thanks to the Astral Phantoms. Just as 
            a precaution, the dragon cast Astral Phantoms once more to protect 
            us just in case another Disintegrator shot was fired. The dragon then 
            continued to fire his lock-on lasers at the exposed weak point. As 
            we continued our assault, the armor surrounding the weak point closed, 
            covering its vulnerable spot. It needed time to recharge. In the mean 
            time, the dragon charged up his laser energy. It was only a matter 
            of time before the armor covering the weak point opened again. When 
            it did, the dragon fired a few more lock-on lasers, and victory was 
            ours!</font></p>

          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">As I approached the northern launch 
            pad, after having destroyed the Control Tower, the Empire launched 
            a mobile warhead destined for Zoah! If I didn't do something fast, 
            all of Zoah and its people would be reduced to ash! As the giant missile 
            ran its course along the launch rail, the dragon, while in Attack 
            form, shot lock-on lasers at both of its main boosters located on 
            the left and right sides of the warhead's tail. Once both of the side 
            boosters were taken out, the dragon continued its array of lock-on 
            lasers, as well as his Armageddon berserk attack, taking major damage. 
            The warhead then launched up into the sky, determined to reach Zoah. 
            We had to destroy this thing, and fast! It was now an all out aerial 
            battle! The dragon continued his bombardment of lock-on lasers, from 
            all different directions and soon changed into his Spiritual form. 
            We needed to end the battle as quickly as possible, and the dragon's 
            Armageddon berserk attack was just what we needed! After taking heavy 
            damage, the warhead detached its stabilizer component. When we fired 
            two more Armageddon attacks, it detached its main booster as well 
            as its horizontal tail wing. It was now reduced to its simplest form, 
            a form of unimaginable destructive power! Time was just about running 
            out. In a last ditch effort to halt the flight path of the warhead, 
            the dragon finished it off with one final Armageddon berserk attack. 
            The warhead detonated just moments away from Zoah. We had saved the 
            Village, it was certainly a most gratifying relief!</font></p>
