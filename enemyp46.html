          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">While passing through the first large 
            door within the ancient ship at Georgius, we encountered three beams 
            of light that manifested into a dragon. The dragon was a lost spirit. 
            It wanted to show us something, so we proceeded to follow it throughout 
            the everlasting corridors inside the ship. It disappeared behind a 
            final green door. Upon opening this door, we were drawn into an indescribable 
            portal of beautiful green light. As the dragon and I flew through 
            this portal, we somehow felt euphoric and at peace with ourselves. 
            As we came out of the portal, we arrived in some kind of large chamber. 
            Directly in front of us, was a large engraving of a dragon, a dragon 
            crest if you will. It was simply awe inspiring!</font></p>

          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">When the dragon accessed the dragon 
            crest, turned it into pure energy, and stored it within its body for 
            safe keeping, a strange little creature emerged from it. My only thoughts 
            were that it must have been the reincarnation of that ghost dragon, 
            since it was last seen traveling towards this room. It must have wanted 
            us to find its resting place, so it could be revived. This little 
            dragon was immediately drawn to our side by its own free will. We 
            had gained a new ally. He wasn't to be taken lightly. He knew just 
            as many tricks as my dragon! He was performing spins, flips and rolls 
            with ease. He was a skilled little guy! Although, I don't think he 
            quite trusted me yet. I guess I would have to work hard in order for 
            him to warm up to me.</font></p>
