            the ancient ships engine rudders, a long stream of energy burst out 
            from behind the ship and took a hold of us! It swung us every which 
            way, like we were mere play toys. The dragon had but one option, and 
            that was to destroy the energy streams with his homing lasers. It 
            was tuff, but my dragon managed to pull it off! When all energy streams 
            dissipated, the ship self-destructed and was completely destroyed. 
            The remnants of the ship fell below the water to its final place of 
            rest.</font></p>
