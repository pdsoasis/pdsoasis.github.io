            while moving through one of the many corridors within the Tower, I 
            observed pure type monsters that were hanging from the ceiling. These 
            creatures were dormant of course, and were of no threat to me or my 
            safety. They were quite strange, nothing like I had ever seen. The 
            creatures had wings like my dragon, as well as a giant abdomen with 
            multiple spikes protruding from it. I just hoped they wouldn't awaken 
            any time soon!</font></p>

            the corridors of the Tower, I noticed we were underwater, near Uru. 
            The walls of the vast corridor were transparent, and I could see many 
            sea creatures swimming past us. Most noticeably among them, was a 
            strange white eel that swam by. It wasn't like the eels from the Uru 
            Passage, I had seen previously. This one was pure white, had a rounded 
            head, and a long thin tail. It was mysterious and awe inspiring, to 
            watch. </font></p>
