            area, I ran straight into a trap laid out by the Empire. The events 
            that soon unfolded were truly horrible. Craymen was gunned down after 
            attempting to kill the Emperor, and Azel was forced to activate the 
            Tower. Worst of all, a giant monster appeared and began to slaughter 
            everyone. The Emperor was no exception, and sadly, Craymen fell victim 
            to the horrible atrocity, as well. The adrenaline was pumping throughout 
            my body, as I began to hastily shoot my gun at the monster. My laser 
            fire was just deflected off of the monsters hard body armor. I kept 
            at it for what seemed like an eternity, and finally, the monster was 
            subdued. An unconscious Azel and I, made our escape out of the Tower, 
            thanks to my dragon.</font></p>

            that it was now fully active. Swarms of monsters began to awaken, 
            and left the confines of the Tower in great swarms. The swarm took 
            down the Imperial fleet stationed outside the Tower, and completely 
            infested the Flagship Grig Orig. There was nothing more I could do, 
            so I made my retreat to safety.</font></p>
