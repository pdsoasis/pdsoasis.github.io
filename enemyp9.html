          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Upon arriving at the Village of Cainus, 
            I saw this mysterious creature siting atop one of the village ruins. 
            It was hard to see, since it was getting dark and was so far up. From 
            what I could make out, it had a pair of wings, a long protruding tail 
            and neck, as well as a small head. The creature seemed pretty harmless. 
            It paid no attention to us and just flew away. But I wonder if it 
            could have been one of the monsters Craymen used to attack the villagers. 
            Maybe its stomach was full so it had no desire to feast on us!</font></p>
