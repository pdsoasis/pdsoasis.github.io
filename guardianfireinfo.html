          </strong>As well as the surrounding walls, that protects us from monsters, 
          the Guardian Fire, an Ancient Age relic found in the Holy District, 
          also plays a great role in helping keep the monsters at bay. It protects 
          the people of Zoah, by keeping the monsters away. It emits a strange 
          light, that emanates across a wide distance. The monsters absolutely 
          can't stand this holy light, and won't dare advance further near the 
          Town. It's vital to our survival! The Power of the Ancients was truly 
          incredible, don't you think? I figure that only the High Priest gets 
          to see it. He's got his Guardian Fire, I've got my illuminating drinks.</font></div></td>

            How it emits such amazing light, is an Ancient Age mystery.</font></p>
