            (Garil Desert) Blue Ruins</font></p>
          <p><strong><font color="#000000" size="6">The Seemingly Unstoppable 
            Gigra</font></strong></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">We came upon a place called the Blue 
            Ruins. As we approached the central ruins, we ran into a problem. 
            The entrance leading underground was buried under the sand. The only 
            way we could get in, was if we could remove the sand somehow. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Gash remembered that his fellow seekers 
            had dug up a relic which had the ability to create tornadoes. If we 
            could get this ruin running, we would be able to clear away the sand. 
            Not too far in the distance, we could see two small relics. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">We first destroyed the northeast relic 
            and then the northwest one. Upon its destruction, the relic did indeed 
            create a massive tornado! It completely removed the sand that was 
            blocking the entrance! The only objective left was to get past the 
            ruins and we would be out of the desert once and for all. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">We proceeded to fly underground. It 
            was simply amazing! We were in an underground cave. We weren't out 
            of hot water yet. It was then that we were confronted by a strange 
            creature. Gash said it was called a Gigralyph. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Gash wondered why such a small creature 
            was found in such large ruins? We had to kill it so we could move 
            on. We managed to weaken it to a near death state. It was then that 
            it called for reinforcements. Something came toward us from under 
            the sand. It soon surfaced beside the Gigralyph. Here was the large 
            monster Gash was expecting, a giant Gigra! After fighting a decisive 
            battle, the Gigra fell to the ground below, completely immobilized. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Just as we were about to take a sigh 
            of relief, the Gigra came back with vengeance! It still wasn't dead. 
            I couldn't believe it! The creature readied a final attack. Just when 
            we thought our lives were over, an amazing thing happened! The dragon 
            changed into a stronger form!! It shot streams of incredibly strong 
            laser fire at the Gigra, completely engulfing it! It finally fell 
            to its eternal resting place. Now, we could finally make our way out 
            of the ruins. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Once out of the desert, we set up 
            camp. Gash told me he was going to go off on his own. He said he would 
            always consider me as his friend and that I could rely on him if I 
            ever needed his help. Before departing, he said I should head east 
            where a caravan was located. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">He gave me a pendant and said if I 
            showed it to the people of the caravan, they would help me out. We 
            said our good-byes and went our separate ways. I was off to the caravan.</font></p>
