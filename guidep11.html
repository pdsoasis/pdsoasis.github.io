          <p><strong><font color="#000000" size="6">A Stranger Amongst Strangers</font></strong></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">I had made it to the caravan, just 
            like Gash said. When I first arrived, I ran into a small boy. He thought 
            I was some new hunter he was expecting. I told him who I really was. 
            He said his name was Enkak. He told me his father was a hunter too. 
            Maybe, he was the man I was looking for. I entered a tent to the far 
            right. Therein, I found a mother and daughter. The mother told me 
            to leave them alone. When I just happened to look at her daughter, 
            see screamed at me with all of her might, to leave the girl alone! 
            I quickly ran for the exit! The next tent I entered, happened to be 
            an item shop. I told myself, now I can restock on much needed items. 
            As I approached the man, he told me to buy something or get out! He 
            said there was nothing for my kind here! Man, would it have killed 
            these people to show a shred of hospitality? I wasn't getting anywhere. 
            I wondered if Gash was as trustworthy as he led on to be. Not one 
            person so far, would talk to me and I didn't think anyone would even 
            think about helping me out! There was only one tent left, I sincerely 
            hoped the person in that tent would recognize my pendant. I found 
            myself in a dimly lit room, a man was siting towards the back. As 
            soon as I entered, he recognized my pendant and immediately knew I 
            was a friend of Gash. Thank God! He told me he almost thought I was 
            with a group of thieving bastards that had recently raided the caravan. 
            Now I knew the reason why everyone gave me such a cold welcome! I 
            sat down and the man and I had a long conversation. I told him about 
            Craymen and his men. He replied by saying the group of thieving men 
            had fit my description. The man told me they went north to a place 
            called the Forbidden Zone. It was an area where a gravity storm blows, 
            a place where horrible drooling creatures with razor sharp teeth dwell. 
            Some call it the Death of 1,000 Pieces, he said. I told him no matter 
            the danger, I had to try to get a shot at Craymen. The man wished 
            me luck, and would try to help me out in any way possible. He told 
            the shop owner Biacah to sell me something from his secret stash. 
            Before I exited the tent, he also told me to sell any spare items 
            I had. Doing so, would greatly help the inhabitants of the caravan, 
            since Crayman had taken almost all of their supplies. Night soon fell 
            upon us, the man finally introduced himself, his name was An'jou. 
            His fire lit up the night sky. He told me a story about his people. 
            He said his people were forced out of their homeland by blood thirsty 
            monsters. They had no choice but to search for a new place to call 
            home. The people I had met throughout the day, were all that was left 
            of a once thriving society. After listening to Anjou's stories, I 
            met a man siting towards the back of the caravan, his name was Raul. 
            He was a hunter for hire, taking watch over the surrounding area. 
            He told me the Imperial Force that came to the caravan was probably 
            a special force, directly under the Emperor. When the sun rose, I 
            headed for Biacah's shop to sell my spare items as well as stock up 
            on Elixirs for the coming battles ahead. Before I departed, I ran 
            into that not so nice mother and daughter. The mother apologized for 
            our earlier encounter and said her name was Kou and her daughters 
            name was Fei. Fei didn't say much, but that was okay, she was just 
            shy. It was time to say good-bye, the dragon and I took off for the 
            Death of 1,000 Pieces, the Forbidden Zone! Craymen here I come!</font></p>
