          <p><strong><font color="#000000" size="6">The Death of 1,000 Pieces</font></strong></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">As we flew through the Forbidden Zone, 
            we came upon a strange machine called the Sky Transporter. It immediately 
            recognized us as intruders, and sealed itself. Its 8 keys separated 
            from the main unit and relocated to different areas. I assumed to 
            reactivate the machine, I would have to reassemble all of its keys. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">It was a grueling process, but we 
            found all 8 keys and repositioned them back into the Sky Transporter. 
            Once the keys were in place, the seal was finally broken and the machine 
            commenced its reactivation process. The dragon shot a laser at the 
            machine and we were pushed up into the air. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Unbeknownst to us, Craymen's Elite 
            Guard had been waiting close by. They descended right in front of 
            us. It was Craymen's ship! I had finally caught up with him! Once 
            we destroyed the Escorts, the main Flagship engaged us in battle. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">The battle soon came to an end as 
            we heavily weakened the ship. I made my way to the main bridge only 
            to find one man aboard. It was Craymen's second hand man! I asked 
            him where Craymen was hiding. He replied by telling me I had fallen 
            into their trap and that Craymen was already at the Tower. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">After our little conversation, he 
            said &quot;she&quot; would finish me. Before I could comprehend what 
            he meant exactly, an explosion blew me back and completely engulfed 
            the man, ending his life instantly! As I recovered from my fall, I 
            saw a girl and a black dragon appear before me. It was the girl from 
            my vision! </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">My dragon in an effort to protect 
            me, shot its lasers at the black dragon. The girl's dragon just created 
            a shield out of pure energy and the laser fire was deflected! I quickly 
            jumped onto my dragon and we flew along side them. I didn't want to 
            fight her but she said, &quot;his enemy is my enemy.&quot; I asked 
            her if she was referring to Craymen. She answered, with laser fire 
            to my dragons body! </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Next, I tried to ask her why she was 
            on Craymen's side. She didn't answer me and the dragon and I were 
            soon caught up in a battle against the two. Once, we managed to weaken 
            her dragon, they made their retreat. She said she would be back! We 
            left the Forbidden Zone and made our way back to the caravan.</font></p>
