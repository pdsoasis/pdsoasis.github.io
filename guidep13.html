          <p><strong><font color="#000000" size="6">A Forest Protected by the 
            Power of the Gods</font></strong></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">After returning from the Forbidden 
            Zone, I headed back to the caravan. When I arrived, I found a monster 
            sprawled out on the ground before me. Enkak told me with much excitement, 
            that his father had brought it back from a successful hunt. Next, 
            I went over to Biahca's shop to sell my useless items I had received 
            from the Forbidden Zone. He was quite happy to take them off my hands 
            for a good amount of Dynes. He also had some new items and gun parts 
            for me. I stocked up on Elixirs and bought this really powerful gun 
            upgrade called the Sniper. Biacah told me it was able to take major 
            damage to any weak point. My next stop was Fei's tent. I had a conversation 
            with her mother Kou. She said the people of the caravan were headed 
            for the Zoah Forest. I told her that there was bound to be monsters 
            there, but she just muttered something about it being protected by 
            the power of the Gods. She also spoke of a large town near the forest, 
            found directly to the east. I thought it a good idea to check it out 
            after my visit. I attempted to talk to her daughter Fei, but she wasn't 
            too happy to talk to a complete stranger. I had to start somewhere, 
            so I didn't stop talking to her until she warmed up to me. I told 
            her I'd be leaving soon, she didn't want me to leave! I guess I had 
            made an impression. At night, I observed An'jou as he readied the 
            innards of the monster he had killed for medicines and antidotes. 
            He said he recently heard rumors that a dragon was fighting against 
            the Imperial Forces. Only if he knew, the person whom was fighting 
            along side that dragon was standing right next to him! But I couldn't 
            bring myself to tell him. I pretended to not know what he was talking 
            about. He said I should be more religious and gave me a Dragon Bible. 
            After chatting with An'jou, I headed out back to see what Raul was 
            up to. He was on guard duty as usual. He asked me to do him a favor. 
            I agreed and he handed me an item called the Verato Pipe. He told 
            me to give it to any survivors I may find from the village Verato. 
            I agreed and left for the Town of Zoah, when the light of morning 
            beamed out from the horizon.</font></p>
