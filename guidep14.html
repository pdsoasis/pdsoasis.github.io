            Village of Zoah</font></p>
          <p><strong><font color="#000000" size="6">Paet's Request</font></strong></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">I soon found myself in the great Village 
            of Zoah. There were so many things to see and do, I didn't know where 
            to start. I walked into an item shop owned by a man named Jared. He 
            had just opened shop not too long ago and had many items to buy. Some 
            books within his shop caught my eye and he said I could take some. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">After talking to him for a while, 
            he told me to go find a man named Juba who knows many things. He also 
            mentioned an old man who wanted him to fix his gun. Jared wasn't too 
            sure if he should fix it, since the man was so old and was in no condition 
            to go out hunting. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">I left Jared's shop and asked the 
            gatekeeper for directions to Juba's. He told me Juba's wasn't open 
            during the day and directed me to a blue door. To the right of the 
            blue door I entered a brown house. Inside, I found the night gatekeeper 
            named Abner. After talking to him repeatedly, he assumed we were good 
            friends and asked me if he could borrow 100 Dynes. Being the nice 
            guy that I am, I agreed. He better pay me back! </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">To the left of Juba's, I found a tunnel 
            which connected to the back of town. It was here that I met a man 
            named Aldo. He wasn't very polite, so I ditched him and headed off 
            in a different direction. To the right of the tunnel, I found the 
            back entrance to Juba's. It wasn't locked! I was inside an empty bar. 
            In the back I found a girl named Jeal. She noticed the Verato Pipe 
            I had been carrying around. She told me she was from the Village Verato. 
            I happily gave it to her fulfilling my promise to Raul. I left out 
            the back entrance and once outside, I noticed a path to the right 
            of Juba's bar. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">I walked a ways up this path and found 
            another house to the right. Within, I found the old man Jared was 
            talking about. His name was Radgam, an old hunter. Looking around 
            his room, I saw a rare Ancient Age gun on a pedestal. It was similar 
            to mine. I wondered how he had acquired it, was he also a dragon rider 
            at one time? When I fixated my eyes upon it, he screamed, &quot;Don't 
            touch that!&quot; I told him I was sorry and that I just couldn't 
            help myself, because it was so rare. After talking to him for a while, 
            he eventually became curious as to my knowledge about monsters. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">He asked me a series of questions. 
            I got them all right! He rewarded me with a Tri-burst gun part. When 
            I left Radgam's house, night had already cast its shadow over the 
            sky. Directly in front of me, I found a strange well. I entered it 
            and emerged in a different section of town. I found a door. Inside, 
            was a small boy called Bezer. He had been hiding from his grandfather. 
            He gave me an Amikhan Ring for promising to keep his hiding spot a 
            secret. It was now time to go see Juba, so I headed off to his bar. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Upon entering, I found a scary shirtless 
            man hovering over a series of illuminated drinks. He wouldn't talk 
            to me unless I ordered one of them, so I gave him 20 Dynes. It tasted 
            horrible, but I pretended to like it and he gave me an Elixir Minor. 
            I asked him about the Empire. He talked about a black ship that I 
            knew nothing about. He also said the Empire was looking for the Tower, 
            found on the other side of the forest. He gave me a picture of the 
            Tower and said to go talk to a man called Paet, if I wanted to know 
            more. He told me to go see him in the morning. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Morning soon arrived, and just as 
            Juba said, I found Paet working on some ancient device towards the 
            back of town. I asked him if he knew anything about the Tower. He 
            refused to tell me, but said he might change his mind if I could find 
            him some ship parts in a place north of the Forbidden Zone called 
            Georgius. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">I had no choice but to agree to his 
            terms. Before venturing off to this unknown place, I returned to the 
            caravan to let Raul know that I had found a survivor from the Village 
            of Verato. He thanked me and gave me a reward of 1000 Dynes. He told 
            me a story about his village. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">The Empire had deemed it necessary 
            to bring the border lands under control. Raul working as a mercenary 
            for the Empire at the time, went ahead to warn his village of the 
            impending danger. The border lands were located near the village, 
            so it was also destroyed with no consideration for the villagers lives. 
            Raul didn't make it on time and had to face the horrifying fact that 
            his fellow villagers were nothing but ash. It was then that he found 
            the Verato Pipe. After his sad tale, I said good-bye and headed off 
            to my next destination, Georgius.</font></p>
