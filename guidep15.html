          <p><strong><font color="#000000" size="6">An Ancient Evil from the Distant 
            Past</font></strong></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">The dragon and I arrived above a place 
            just to the north of the Forbidden Zone, called Georgius. Straight 
            in front of us was a gigantic tornado. We had to force our way through 
            hordes of monsters, just to reach it. Once we reached the tornado, 
            we made our decent into the unknown depths. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Below, we found a group of ancient 
            guardians circling around the base of the tornado. They seemed to 
            be protecting something. I was not sure what, but we had to destroy 
            them to find out. The dragon obliterated each and every one of them, 
            with no remorse. When the final guardian was destroyed, the tornado 
            dissipated. Soon after, a massive Ancient Age ship emerged! I knew 
            for sure, I would be able to get some ship parts from such a massive 
            relic. Just as I had surmised, right under the ship was an item box 
            containing the much needed ship parts. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">I immediately returned to Zoah to 
            tell Paet the good news. Paet inspected the parts with an angry look 
            on his face. He told me they were nothing but useless junk. He insisted 
            that I return to Georgius to find him better parts. I returned to 
            Georgius once more. Upon arriving, I noticed something strange on 
            the side of the giant ship. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">A large hole had been blasted into 
            the side. I left the dragon behind and examined the interior of the 
            ship on foot. I couldn't believe what I was seeing! An Imperial squadron 
            had invaded the inside of the ship and were attempting to revive a 
            horrible monster! Luck wasn't on my side that day. I was caught by 
            a patrolling Imperial soldier and brought onboard their Gunship to 
            be interrogated. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">After being beaten senseless, the 
            commander told me that Craymen planned to destroy the world with the 
            destructive force of the Tower. I was then tortured, until I blacked 
            out from the excruciating pain. My luck soon turned around. Gash had 
            been aboard the ship investigating this incident. He found my location 
            and freed me. We made our escape to the deck. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">The dragon was waiting for us outside. 
            We immediately boarded him and flew beside the Gunship. Below the 
            Gunship was that horrible monster I had seen before I was caught. 
            Gash told me it alone, was the reason why the Empire came to such 
            a place. They had unearthed a great evil slain by a dragon long ago. 
            We had to destroy the Gunship along with the menacing monster it was 
            carrying. As the battle ensued, something unexpected occurred. The 
            monster below the ship came to life and completely destroyed the Gunship 
            with its powerful lasers! I thought it was dead, but to my amazement, 
            Gash told me some ancient beasts can't truly die until they have fulfilled 
            their purpose. My dragon's presence must have awakened it. After a 
            long drawn out battle, the horrible monster was finally put to rest. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">We headed back to camp to take a much 
            needed rest. While at camp I realized I hadn't gotten any new ship 
            parts for Paet! As I began to freak out, Gash with good intentions, 
            gave me the ship parts I needed so badly. I only had to owe him a 
            favor in return. I returned to Zoah, hoping Paet would finally tell 
            me all he knew about the Tower. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">When I gave him the parts, the dumb 
            fool said he didn't need them anymore! And after all I went through! 
            The look on my face struck fear into his eyes. He couldn't even remember 
            my name. He was more interested in my dragon, which he saw with the 
            help of his viewing device. He made me promise to let him see it someday. 
            Paet told me the Tower was located to the northeast, beyond a lake 
            called Uru. He showed me this place with his viewing machine. It was 
            quite amazing! Before the machine broke, I saw that girl with the 
            black dragon. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Paet thought there was a way to get 
            into the Tower by way of Uru. It was inaccessible from the sky due 
            to the thick fog. I told him I had to leave right away. He said if 
            I needed anything, I could stop by anytime during the day. As I walked 
            away, Paet yelled, &quot;Don't forget about our deal!&quot; Those 
            words echoed throughout my ears making me feel uneasy. I headed off 
            to Uru!</font></p>
