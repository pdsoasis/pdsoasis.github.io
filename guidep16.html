          <p><strong><font color="#000000" size="6">Craymen's Trap: The Protect 
            Key Ordeal</font></strong></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Before venturing off to Uru, I took 
            it upon myself to go visit Fei, at the caravan. I found her in the 
            back washing a Coolia. When I approached her, see gave me a Palmer 
            Amulet and said it was a good luck charm worn by hunters. In return, 
            I gave her the Amirkhan Ring I had received from Bezer. She was much 
            happier now and I could tell she was starting to like me a lot. I 
            had no time for love, the adventure awaiting me at Uru, beckoned me 
            to leave. I said my good-byes and was off to Uru. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">It was just as Paet showed me, the 
            Sunken Southern Ruins of Uru. I remembered him saying that the black 
            dragon had flown to Uru Deep North, or so it was called. As I flew 
            north, I could see strange ruins to the west and east, each facing 
            each other on opposite sides. When I examined the one to the west, 
            a voice spoke out a message telling me to enter Protect Key code for 
            Protect Key # 1. It seemed that I needed some sort of key. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Examining the one to the east gave 
            me a similar message, telling me to enter Protect Key code for Protect 
            Key # 2. I wondered where these Protect Keys could be? Flying farther 
            north brought the dragon and I to a cave. In front of the cave was 
            something that looked like a Keystone, blocking the entrance. There 
            was also a long tunnel behind it. I knew the tunnel had to take me 
            past the cliffs, but I had to find a way to remove the Keystone first. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">From the cave, we flew a little ways 
            to the southeast. We came upon yet another Keystone. Swimming below 
            it was a Kinoshita Whale. I had previously thought those creatures 
            were extinct! He seemed to want a lot of attention, so I had the dragon 
            shoot a laser at it. In a playful manner, the whale knocked over the 
            Keytone with its tail! We flew back to the one near the cave and found 
            another Kinoshita Whale. Once the whale swam under the Keystone, the 
            dragon shot a laser at its head. The whale knocked over the Keytone, 
            reveling the opening to the cave. Even though the Keystone blocking 
            the cave was gone, something just wasn't quite right. The tunnel behind 
            the cave wasn't connected to the northern cliffs. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">We flew behind the cave and along 
            its tunnel. Near the middle of the tunnel we found a rotating device. 
            The dragon shot a laser at it 3 times, causing it to rotate the tunnel 
            and connect it to the cliffs. Now we entered the cave and made our 
            way into the passage. As we flew through the underwater tunnels, we 
            could see an abundance of wondrous sea life which occupied the surrounding 
            area. We exited the passage into Uru Deep North. We were then immediately 
            ambushed by Craymen's Fleet. We made quick work of them. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">I wondered what they were doing here? 
            Directly west of the exit, we found a strange glowing ruin. When we 
            examined it, a massage told me that the underground facilities had 
            been sealed with three keys. In order go gain entry, I would have 
            to collect all three Protect Keys and deactivate the seal. It also 
            said the controls to the guardian Drenholm, had also been deactivated 
            and I should use caution when unlocking the seals. After hearing the 
            message we explored some more and found a series of black ruins, submerged 
            under the water. I knew this had to be the way into the underground 
            facilities. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">West of the black ruins we found a 
            small alcove containing a panel. When we examined the panel, we received 
            Protect Key # 1. The ruins said if I unlocked the seals with the keys, 
            I would be able to understand the purpose of this place. We left Uru 
            Deep North and headed back to Uru Sunken Southern Ruins. As we flew 
            back to the first Protect Key ruin, we were ambushed by Craymen's 
            Fleet once more. They just wouldn't give up and we had to take them 
            down yet again. Craymen's forces seemed to be everywhere! I wondered 
            if these ruins were linked with the Tower? </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">We finally made our way over to the 
            first Protect Key ruin. When we activated it, we received a message 
            telling us to confirmed Protect Key # 1. That's how it worked! The 
            first seal had been broken. I knew something must have changed in 
            Uru Deep North, where I found the key. We returned there to find the 
            black ruins had raised out of the water! To the east of the black 
            ruins, we found another alcove containing Protect Key # 2. We made 
            our way back to Uru Sunken Southern Ruins once more and headed for 
            the second Protect Key ruin. Craymen's Fleet, the bastards, attacked 
            us for the third time! This time, they went all out and sent wave 
            after wave of battle ships. After the long drawn out battle, we activated 
            the second Protect Key ruin and confirmed Protect Key # 2. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">After doing so, the ruin suddenly 
            shot a laser stream over to the Protect Key ruin across from it! This 
            caused something strange to occur. The armored plating that surrounded 
            the Protect Keys, began to fall off. It was then that we ran into 
            Zastava, the man who played a major role in the murdering of my friends! 
            He said I had just activated the Guardians of Uru and would soon be 
            reunited with all of my dead friends. He flew away with his aerial 
            flying machine, laughing at our unfortunate situation. The dragon 
            attempted to shoot homing lasers at the creep, but amazingly he just 
            dodged them. It was no use dealing with him now, the two guardians 
            had formed into one being called Drenholm, just like the ancient recording 
            said. We were in for the battle of our lives! </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">It was a close one, but we managed 
            to defeat the two guardians and survive. Craymen's forces were smarter 
            than I thought. They were the ones who deactivated the controls to 
            Drenholm. Once we confirmed the Protect Keys, the guardians awakened 
            and we were left to do their dirty work. It was all just a stupid 
            trap! Well, on the positive side we had broken the second seal, so 
            it was time to head back over to Uru Deep North and see if anything 
            happened to the Black Ruins. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Upon Returning there, we found that 
            the ruins were now moving around in a circular motion. Next to the 
            Black Ruins, we found a strange green symbol. When we examined it 
            a message told us to enter protect Key code for Protect Key # 3. It 
            was the final seal! Every time I broke a seal, something would change. 
            If there was a passage that lead to the Tower, it had to be here. 
            We eventually found Protect Key # 3, south of the Black Ruins. After 
            our ordeal with the Protect Keys, Craymen's Fleet and the Guardians, 
            the dragon and I were exhausted. Before confirming the last key, we 
            left Uru and headed back to camp. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">After the dragon and I rested up, 
            I thought I'd give him some much needed attention for fighting so 
            hard. After petting him 6 times, I left camp and Upon returning the 
            next day, we formed a special bond. To show his thanks, for taking 
            such good care of him, the dragon learned Astral Phantoms, a technique 
            that would surely help us out in the future battles to come. Before 
            heading back to Uru Deep North, I made sure to go visit Jared's shop 
            in the Village of Zoah and stock up on supplies such as: Elixir Medis, 
            Berserk Minors and Free Actions. After preparing ourselves for the 
            many battles that awaited us, we headed back to Uru Deep North. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">With Protect Key # 3 in hand, we activated 
            the green symbol once more and finally confirmed the last Protect 
            Key. A message told us that plant entry was granted. As soon as the 
            message ended, strange lights began to surround the Black Ruins and 
            a portal appeared above them. It was our way in! We flew towards the 
            portal only to be attacked by that girl and her dragon! We dodged 
            her dragon's laser fire, ultimately engaging them in another battle 
            to the death. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">After the dragon and I weakened the 
            girl's dragon, both of our dragons in a final attempt to take each 
            other out, rammed one another with giant force fields. The girl told 
            me that if I interfere with Craymen's plans again, she would kill 
            me. I told her she didn't truly know him and that he was an insane 
            madman! Before we both could say anything more, the two opposing force 
            fields shattered and the girl and I were flung off of our dragons. 
            We fell downward, one after the other into the portal. Without our 
            dragons, it would be a life or death battle surviving the Underground 
            Ruins of Uru.</font></p>
