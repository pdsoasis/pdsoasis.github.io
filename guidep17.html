          <p><strong><font color="#000000" size="6">Survival of the Fittest</font></strong></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">The girl and I, had fallen off of 
            our dragons and into a portal, leading down into the underground ruins 
            of Uru. I awoke to find I was trapped, had no dragon and no way of 
            getting back out. In my depressing moment of loneliness, I was treated 
            to the horrifying sound of ravaging monsters, drawing closer to feast 
            on my helpless body. I wasn't going to let that happen! As they drew 
            near, I aimed my gun, ready to fire upon the terrible creatures. It 
            was then, that I heard the girl speak out. She told me not to shoot, 
            or I would alert them that food was near. If I were to pull the trigger, 
            they would swarm me, she said. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">The creatures were blind and wouldn't 
            be able to find me, as long as I stayed quiet. The monsters scurried 
            past me. The girls advice had saved my life. She then told me to lower 
            my weapon. I lit a match in an attempt to find her location. Her bright 
            face emerged from the darkness. I told her to come out slowly and 
            I would think about lowering my gun. She told me she would have, if 
            her legs weren't pinned under a hovering device. I said I would help 
            her, if she would show me the way to the Tower. It was useless, the 
            entrance was already sealed, she said. She then made it a point to 
            tell me that the monsters down here were more deadlier than anything 
            I had previously faced. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">I thought it best for us to work together. 
            It was going to be the survival of the fittest, in this monster infested 
            place. I put my gun away, pressed a switch under the hovering device 
            and the girl was freed. I told her when we get out of here, I wanted 
            some answers. She made sure that we hurry along, because more monsters 
            were on the way. I synchronized my High Vulcan gun part with the hovering 
            device and the girl and I rode off into the ruin depths of B1F. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">I wondered what we would do now? The 
            girl said at the dome below us, there was an elevator that would be 
            able to bring us directly to the surface. If we could get there, we 
            would be able to leave this place, that is, if we could get there 
            without being eaten! On our left, we found a gate. A message told 
            us that Gate # 1 was closed. We needed to find a way to open it. As 
            we flew north from Gate # 1, we found a switch. We proceeded to activate 
            this switch, in the hope that it would unlock Gate # 1. Luckily, it 
            did just that. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">We moved past Gate # 1 to the next 
            area. To the left we found another gate. Another message said Gate 
            # 2 was closed. I knew we needed to find another gate switch. We headed 
            south. Upon heading in this direction, we flew over the carcasses 
            of dead monsters. It was then that we were immediately ambushed by 
            more blood thirsty monsters, that wanted us as their next meal! They 
            both jumped at each other, fighting for the pleasure of consuming 
            our flesh. We quickly destroyed them with the hover devices lock-on 
            lasers. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Moving further south, lead us to a 
            southern chamber containing another switch. It unlocked Gate # 2. 
            We headed past the gate and rode an elevator down to B2F East. A northern 
            path brought us to a water tank. Moving a ways north from that water 
            tank, brought us to a second water tank. Each tank was devoid of water, 
            making it impossible to cross over to the other side, unless we could 
            find a way to fill them with water somehow. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">We continued north, moving down a 
            descending slope. The girl told me that the floater, or so she called 
            it, was loosing power and wouldn't be able to go back up any steep 
            slopes. I asked her why she didn't tell me that before? It was too 
            late now, we had already gone down the slope! I told her I would ask 
            her before doing anything, even wiping my nose! She agreed and said 
            to continue going strait, she wanted to see something. I wondered 
            what? We crossed over a third water tank, this one was filled, allowing 
            us to move along to the other side. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">We found ourselves in a room full 
            of strange hanging creatures. I asked her what this place was? The 
            creatures looked very similar to my dragon. &quot;Long ago, this place 
            was a genetics lab, where prototype dragons were created,&quot; she 
            said. &quot;The project was terminated before they were finished.&quot; 
            She also said that humans created them and my dragon as well. I was 
            completely surprised! I couldn't believe that humans had created such 
            a wondrous and powerful creature, such as my dragon! Before leaving, 
            we found another switch inside the room. We activated it, wondering 
            what it was going to do. The girl heard water flowing. She said a 
            waterway gate must have opened somewhere. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Upon leaving the room, we saw that 
            the water from the third tank we had crossed, was now drained. We 
            descended down into the tank. It was a long drop. The tanks were connected 
            vertically to the floors above. I asked the girl if she was hurt? 
            She seemed to not understand what that word meant. Anyway, we found 
            a switch right next to us. We activated it, assuming it would fill 
            water tanks # 1 and # 2. From B3F East we rode an eastern elevator 
            back up to B2F East. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Before crossing over water tank # 
            1 to the underground dome, we first crossed over water tank # 2 and 
            found an item box there. It contained a Hunting Scythe technique that 
            the dragon could learn. We proceeded to cross over water tank # 1 
            and entered the dome. We fell downward to the surrounding green water 
            below. We weren't able to go back up and the door nearby asked us 
            to enter the Dome Gate Key, so we left through the western door to 
            B3F West, in an attempt to find the key. The girl said once we found 
            the key, we would be able to enter an elevator that would take us 
            to the surface. To our right, we found the third gate. A message said 
            Gate # 3 was closed. We found the corresponding gate switch in a southern 
            chamber, but not before a monster jumped out from a protruding wall 
            and scared the hell out of us! After defeating the monster, we activated 
            the switch in the southern chamber and moved past Gate # 3. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">We then took the elevator we found 
            at the end of the path, to B4F. We had traveled a long way. I wondered 
            how far down we were? The girl answered by saying we were four floors 
            down. From this point on everything was going to slope downhill, she 
            said. The Dome Gate Key would probably be somewhere in the middle, 
            at the end of one of the branching passages. I hoped we weren't going 
            to get lost! Eventually, after taking multiple paths, we finally found 
            the Dome Gate Key. I hoped it would open the gate that would take 
            us to the surface, because I wanted to get out of this monster infested 
            place! </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">We returned to the dome, only to have 
            to face a strange creature atop a nest, high above us. After destroying 
            its nest, the creature made its escape. We let it go, for we had greater 
            things to worry about, escaping this god forsaken place! I wanted 
            to know why there were so many monsters so deep inside these ruins? 
            The girl explained to me that the creatures had mutated since they 
            were born here. She also said the fleet took serious damage coming 
            through here too. Craymen's Fleet had been through here? I should 
            have known he would try coming here. The monsters now knew we had 
            destroyed their nest, so we left without a moments notice. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">We opened the dome gate, barely making 
            it to the elevator before being eaten alive by a gigantic, furious 
            monster. As we rode the elevator up to the surface, we had a long 
            conversation. I told the girl that I didn't even know her name. &quot;Azel&quot; 
            she said. Her name was Azel! I told her it was a strange name. Azel 
            told me it was inscribed on the bed where she awoke, after having 
            slept for thousands of years. She also told me she may look human, 
            but internally, she was closer to the creatures we'd been fighting. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">I asked her why she attacked me? &quot;You 
            stand in his way,&quot; she said. I asked her why she protects Craymen? 
            She told me he is trying to save the world, to return it to its former 
            state. Yeah, that's a load of Coolia's Dung! She wouldn't allow anyone 
            who stands in his way to come near him, she said. I told her he was 
            a lying murderer! &quot;To gain control of the Tower, Craymen killed 
            my Captain and my friends&quot;, I screamed. I told Azel, he was only 
            lying to her. &quot;Even though he may be lying I choose to defend 
            him, because he awoke me from my eternal sleep,&quot; she said. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Telling her about how we were betrayed 
            and the killing of my friends at the excavation site where she was 
            found, caused her to say she was sorry. It was kind of peculiar. She 
            said she was supposed to apologize at a time like this, or so she 
            was taught. She then asked me how I could control my dragon so well? 
            before I could give her a conclusive answer, the elevator was suddenly 
            torn open by another monster and we fell to our immediate deaths! 
            Just when I thought our lives would be over, my dragon came to the 
            rescue, putting us in protective force fields! We rode straight to 
            the surface, with the monster trailing just mere inches behind us! 
            </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Upon reaching the surface, we had 
            no choice but to subdue the angry beast. It wanted revenge for destroying 
            the nest. Also, atop its head, was that small creature that escaped 
            when it was destroyed. We soon fought an intense battle against the 
            thing, coming away victorious. My dragon even upgraded to a more powerful 
            form! I told her how daring my dragon and I had been, throughout the 
            battle. Something was wrong. &quot;Atolm calls, I must leave,&quot; 
            she said. Once we were on solid ground, she walked off into the distance 
            saying, &quot; Just stay out of his way, or else we will have to kill 
            you.&quot; Her dragon swooped upward taking her off her feet and they 
            flew into the sunset, without even saying good-bye. So much for the 
            bonds of friendship!</font></p>
