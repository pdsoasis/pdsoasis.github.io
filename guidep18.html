          <p><strong><font color="#000000" size="6">The Desperate Search for the 
            Tobitama Rock</font></strong></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">After escaping the Underground Ruins 
            of Uru, I decided I needed a break and returned to the caravan, to 
            spend some time with Fei. Upon entering her tent, Kou told me that 
            she was looking after Enkak, who had been stricken with Meccania fever. 
            She said his fever was very bad and wouldn't go down. I rushed over 
            to An'jou's tent to find Enkak asleep and Fei trembling over him. 
            She told me he had become ill and wouldn't wake up. I checked his 
            head, he was burning up! If someone didn't do something soon, he wasn't 
            going to last long. I left Fei and went to talk to Baicah about Enkak's 
            fever. He to, said it must be Meccania fever. He said, if he were 
            to get his hands on a rock-like secretion called a Tobitama Rock, 
            found inside a Tobitama nest, he would be able to make an antidote. 
            He also told me that An'jou had already ventured off on a desperate 
            search to find the Tobitamas. The chance of him finding one he said, 
            was next to nothing. I knew I had to be the one to help Enkak, I had 
            to do something. I couldn't just let him die. I could find the Tobitama 
            Rock in no time, thanks to my dragon, that is, if I knew where to 
            look. Where would I start looking, I told myself? Who could I ask, 
            to find out more information about Tobitamas? Just as I began to slump 
            into a void of hopelessness, I remembered the all knowing Juba! If 
            anyone could help me, he most certainly could. I rushed over to the 
            Village of Zoah, without a moments notice! During the night, I made 
            my way to Juba's bar. I had to pay 20 Dynes and order one of his illuminating 
            drinks of course, for him to even talk to me. Once I downed the horrible 
            drink, my face turned green as I desperately pleaded with Juba to 
            give me any information he knew about Tobitamas. He told me to calm 
            down, it was no problem. He said the Tobitamas had supposedly returned 
            to Uru, since the water level had risen. At a young age, these strange 
            birds fly away and if all the young return to the nest at the same 
            time, they abandon it, he told me. I thanked him, and hurried to Uru, 
            as fast as the dragon could take me there. When we arrived, we ran 
            into one of the baby Tobitamas right away. He circled around us, wanting 
            us to bring him to his mother. I had to find the nest. We proceeded 
            to fly north and eventually found the mother Tobitama, sitting at 
            her nest. The baby Tobitama happily flew by his mothers side. There 
            must be more, I thought to myself. Flying south from the nest, lead 
            us to yet another baby Tobitama, which we also brought back to the 
            nest. I knew there had to be more. While flying to the right of the 
            cave entrance and towards the cliffs, we found the last baby Tobitama. 
            Upon bringing him back to his mother, they all abandoned the nest, 
            just like Juba said. We found the rock-like secretion laying in the 
            nest, that the Tobitamas had left behind. Next, we headed back to 
            Uru Deep North. We then accessed the green symbol next to the Black 
            Ruins and entered the underground ruins of Uru. I wanted to get some 
            items that were previously unattainable without my dragon. We made 
            our way to B4F and acquired multiple items from a row of 9 item containers, 
            that I previously was unable to open with the Floater. The dragon 
            however, had no problem blasting open the item containers with its 
            lock-on lasers. After B4F, I headed back to the Underground Dome and 
            flew high above, to find a door we weren't able to get into on our 
            last visit, B2F North. Inside, I found D Unit 07 and a powerful healing 
            item called Ambrosia. Soon after, we headed off to B2F East, to take 
            a look at the Prototype Dragons once more, before exiting the facility. 
            While attempting to cross over Water Tank # 3, the dragon was pulled 
            downward and we descended to a new floor, B?F. The gate in front of 
            us relayed a message telling us Bio Equipment was prohibited. It meant 
            no dragons. I left my dragon behind and told him to meet me at the 
            exit. I explored a series of complex branching paths. One of the paths 
            took me to another unknown floor, B??F, where I found some cool items. 
            All of the other paths eventually took me to B3F East. It was here 
            that we encountered a more intelligent form of Absorbora, near the 
            descending slope leading up to the Water Tank # 1 and # 2 Switch. 
            They threw around a bomb back and froth between each other. We quickly 
            destroyed them before the bomb exploded. After our business was complete 
            within the underground ruins of Uru, we headed back to B1F and with 
            the Dome Gate Key in hand, we were able to exit via the giant gate. 
            It was then that I realized I had just done something very stupid. 
            Enkak was dying a slow death back at the caravan and there I was, 
            exploring the underground ruins of Uru at my own leisure. With a feeling 
            of incredible anxiety, I rushed my behind over to Baicah and sold 
            him the Tobitama Rock. I hoped it wasn't too late! He was ecstatic 
            that I had actually found the Tobitamas. Baicah could now make the 
            antidote that would hopefully save Enkak's life. As thanks, he gave 
            me five Speed Chips. As I waited in anticipation, the darkness of 
            night soon engulfed the sky. I found Raul sitting by the fire, talking 
            to himself. He was worried about An'jou and wondered if he was going 
            to be okay. Raul was the only hunter left to defend the people of 
            the caravan. He must have been very stressed out. I waited until morning 
            and went back to check how Baicah's antidote was coming along. He 
            had already completed it and given it to Enkak during the night. He 
            said it looked as if the boy was going to make it. With great excitement, 
            I ran over to An'jou's tent and checked up on him. His fever was going 
            down and it seemed that he would wake up soon. Fei was surprised and 
            relieved that I had actually saved Enkak's life. I walked away, took 
            one last look at Enkak and knew I had done a good deed. Poor Enkak, 
            I hope he'll be okay. Well, I'll make sure to come back later. I headed 
            off to camp to take a much needed rest.</font></p>
