            of Zoah Visit 2</font></p>
          <p><strong><font color="#000000" size="6">A District of Holy Men</font></strong></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">After saving Enkak's Life, I decided 
            to return to camp to get some much needed rest. To my surprise, Paet 
            was there waiting for me. I told him that I had failed to get into 
            the Tower. He said it was great news! Great news!? It was then and 
            there I believed he had gone completely crazy! He happily explained 
            to me, that he had found a way to fly to the Tower. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">An ancient ship called Mel-Kava protects 
            it by creating fog. Also called &quot;God's Carriage.&quot; Supposedly 
            it fought in a huge battle ages ago, over the Tower. If the ship were 
            to be destroyed, so would the fog, revealing the way. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Paet told me to find some more information 
            at the Village of Zoah, in a place called the Holy District. Before 
            departing for the Village of Zoah, I went to the Excavation Site, 
            to pay my respects to my deceased Captain. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">When I arrived, I found the horrible 
            sight of Radgam's lifeless body. His back had been broken and his 
            blood drained from his body! Most likely by monsters. He died a hunters 
            death. I took his unloaded Large Gun with me and left for the Village 
            of Zoah. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">When I got there, I quickly hid myself 
            from view. The Empire had occupied the town while I was gone, and 
            soon it would be overtaken by their greedy hands. After listening 
            in on their conversation, they soon departed and the light of day 
            had turned into the darkness of night. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">During the night, I thought I'd go 
            return the Large Gun to it's rightful place, on the pedestal in Radgam's 
            house. I found two Recovers in his toolbox. Thinking things through, 
            I decided to keep the Large Gun, to show as proof that he had indeed 
            left this world. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Towards the back of town, I saw a 
            bright light coming from Aldo's house. Inside, I found some Lamp oil 
            from an old lamp on the floor and a Shield Chip under a sheet near 
            his ladder. I also stumbled upon a back room wherein, I found Aldo 
            himself, hiding from the Empire. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">I showed him Radgam's gun and told 
            him I had found it in the valley, next to his dead body. His eyes 
            had a sad distant look, the kind of look when you've lost someone 
            you respect. I noticed he had a Dual Blast Chip inside his toolbox. 
            He told me he wouldn't be needing it, and let me keep it. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">As we talked the night away, he explained 
            to me that he was once a part of Radgam's hunting crew. His friends 
            were all brutally murdered by monsters, leaving him and Radgam as 
            the only survivors. It was then that he, as well as Radgam escaped 
            to this town to make an easy living far away from the retched monsters 
            that had killed their friends. </font><font color="#000000" size="5">Radgam 
            never gave up his hunting ways, and was a hunter right up to the moment 
            he died. I told him it was the right thing to do. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">The next day, I ran into Abner. He 
            angrily gave me a pass to the Holy District, saying that I hadn't 
            earned it. He told me about a man named Vaiman, who was second in 
            command to the High Priest and was also Paets father. He wanted to 
            see me. His house was behind the church, in the Holy District. I proceeded 
            to make my way into the Holy District. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">To the left of the Liberal District 
            entrance, I found a Zoah Harvest near some edible hanging plants. 
            Straight ahead was a grain storehouse. To the left of the storehouse, 
            I found a recover among a bush of Hammond fruit. To its right, I found 
            another Zoah Harvest. I entered the storehouse and met a man named 
            Boaz. He told me to get out, but I showed him my pass. He ranted on 
            about how he believed trade with the outside world, only brings trouble. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Next, I entered the church to the 
            far left of the storehouse. I met Damon, the High Priest. He told 
            me to leave as soon as my business was finished, not a very welcoming 
            man. Moving on toward the back of the church, I met the grain seller 
            I had seen when I first visited Zoah. His name was Quitor. Upon talking 
            to him, he gave me 200 Dynes. It was just a bribe to keep my mouth 
            shut, since I had seen him commencing in trade with outsiders, but 
            I happily took it. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">After repeatedly talking to him, he 
            offered to sell me Zaal Nuts for 500 Dynes. I took him up on his offer. 
            These nuts were valuable and could catch a high price at any shop. 
            Talking to Quitor yet again for a long period of time, caused him 
            to notice my Macran Jewel I had received from the Kolbas at Uru. He 
            offered to buy it from me for 9000 Dynes. I turned him down, it was 
            worth more than that. His next offer was 10000 Dynes. I graciously 
            excepted since I had another one anyway. He was very grateful, since 
            you couldn't find them around here. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Behind Quitor, I found a little girl. 
            When I tried to talk to her, she ran away and hid herself. It wasn't 
            too hard to find her hiding spot and when I did, she warmed up to 
            me. She said her mother told her outsiders like myself don't have 
            any food and gave me some more Zaal Nuts. It was nice of her to do 
            such a thing, but also insulting at the same time. She also gave me 
            a mysterious item called an Aronak Unit. What a nice little girl she 
            was. Inside the fire pit where she hid behind, I found a book called 
            Bible 1. I knew only Paet would try to burn a thing like this. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Next, I finally made it over to Vaiman's 
            estate. When I entered his room, Paet gave me a warning to be careful 
            of his political father. He then stormed out of the room. After a 
            long conversation, the short chubby man persuaded me to fight the 
            Empire, and protect the town from their filthy hands in the process. 
            He said the Imperial Fleet was stationed at an air force post northwest 
            of Uru. He was thrilled that I had agreed to help him out and upon 
            leaving, he gave me 1500 Dynes to keep our little conversation a secret. 
            I left Vaiman and returned to the Liberal District. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Abner approached me, telling me he 
            couldn't pay me back the 100 Dynes he had previously borrowed. I knew 
            this would happen! On the positive side he said I could take anything 
            from his house I wanted, during the night. I then entered Jared's 
            shop and decided that I'd sell Radgam's Large Gun to him. I received 
            a hefty sum of 1500 Dynes. Soon after, I made sure to sell my useless 
            items to him, and stalk up on healing items. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">The day was coming to an end once 
            more, as I made my way towards the end of town to see Paet. He was 
            surprised I was really going to take the job that his father had given 
            me. But it was something I had to do. He said I could stop by his 
            house at night. I couldn't pass up the offer to see the great inventors 
            room, so I agreed. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Night soon fell upon the town. I thought 
            I'd go see how old Juba was doing. Upstairs, I found a seeker named 
            Jephthah. He gave me a Tower Report. I wondered where he got such 
            a thing? As I continued to talk to him some more, he offered to sell 
            me a Tri-Burst gun part he had recovered from some nearby ruins. 1000 
            Dynes was too much, so I pleaded with him to lower the price to 800 
            Dynes. I actually got him to sell it to me for that price and got 
            a real bargain! He wasn't too happy though, realizing what he had 
            just done. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">After visiting Juba's bar, I remembered 
            Abner told me I could take anything I wanted from his house during 
            the night, so I entered his house. To the right of the door, I found 
            a pile of junk! The best thing I could find was a book on the dragon, 
            called Dragon Book 2. I hastily left, realizing I still had to go 
            see Paet before the night was through. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">I ran myself over to the Holy District 
            and down an alley, to the left of Vaiman's estate. I noticed a ladder 
            leading up into a dimly lit window. It was Paet's room! He let down 
            the ladder and I climbed up as fast as I could. His room was amazing, 
            full of all kinds of ancient gadgets. When examining his bookshelf, 
            he said I could have a book I had my eye on, called Dragon Book 3. 
            Before leaving, Paet told me he had sealed off the stairs to keep 
            his father out. He continued to say that if his father truly had to 
            defend the town on his own, he would desert it like a true coward. 
            Not a good son and father relationship, if you ask me. I thanked him 
            for the book and finally left Zoah. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Before heading off to the Imperial 
            Air Force Post, I went to see Raul at the caravan. To my amazement, 
            he gave me a Base Manual, depicting the Imperial Air Force Post's 
            weakness. The inner walls surrounding the Control Tower remain closed. 
            These walls only open while taking in supplies or during a Red Alert 
            to allow reinforcements to attack. This would be my opportunity to 
            advance to the Control Tower and completely take it out. Thanks to 
            Raul, with this vital knowledge, I left for the Imperial Air Force 
            Post to give the Empire Hell!</font></p>

            Go behind the church, and you'll find a man named <strong>Quitor</strong>. 
            First, talk to him and he'll give you <strong>200 Dynes</strong>,

            for 500 Dynes, and you can sell them to a shop later on for 1500 Dynes. 
            Third, talk to him repeatedly again, until he asks if he can buy the 
            Macran Jewel you received from fighting the Kolbas, at Uru. He will 
            offer you 9000 Dynes at first. Choose the option, do not sell. He 
            will then offer you 10000 Dynes, except this offer and <strong>10000
