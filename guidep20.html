          <p><strong><font color="#000000" size="6">Shrouded in the Early Morning

          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Shrouded in the early morning fog, 
            I made my way into the Imperial Air Force Post. A Yellow Alert was 
            immediately commenced, and all surrounding searchlights turned on. 
            The dragon took on his Spiritual form, for the coming battles ahead. 
            As we flew straight ahead, the dragon started destroying everything 
            around him, including: nearby fans, and searchlights. We destroyed 
            as many searchlights as we could, in order to pass undetected. Unfortunately, 
            we made a slight mistake and flew over one of the searchlights by 
            accident. It was then that we were engaged by an imperial battleship. 
            We made quick work of it. Our presence was now known and we had to 
            fight our way through many Imperial ships. After a while, we managed 
            to make it to one of the four walls surrounding the Control Tower. 
            As we attempted to pass over it, an Imperial cannon stopped us in 
            our tracks. The walls were too heavily guarded, I knew I had to destroy 
            the Anchored Fleet first. As we explored the area, I counted twenty 
            anchored ships in all. It was time to start destroying them. As we 
            approached one, I noticed three supply crates under the ship. I made 
            sure to have the dragon lock-on to each crate one by one, as well 
            as the ship itself. The dragon's lasers completely destroyed the ship 
            and we received the three items inside the crates, before everything 
            fell into the murky waters. For each ship, we received 3 items. When 
            we destroyed ten ships, we were greeted by a massive Imperial battlestation. 
            After we destroyed it, a Red Alert sounded, the outer most walls began 
            to rise, and the walls surrounding the Control Tower descended into 
            the water. They had now completely spotted me! Things weren't going 
            as I planned it, and I wondered why I got the idea that I could sneak 
            up on an Imperial Assault Post? I had to act fast. This was our chance! 
            We made our way to the Control Tower. The journey didn't go so smoothly, 
            though. We were attacked by multiple battleships. After many life 
            or death battles, we finally arrived at the Control Tower. It had 
            six break away points, all of which we had to destroy. Once these 
            six break away points were destroyed, the tower exploded! An alarm 
            was then sent to the northern launch pad. I had to make my way over 
            there. On my way, I made sure to get the items from the remaining 
            ten ships. When I reached the northern launch pad, the dragon shot 
            a laser at it. The Imperial soldiers were readying a giant warhead, 
            destined for Zoah! The rail lifts raised, and the warhead was sent 
            along the rails to be launched up into the sky. I had little time 
            to fool around, I had to stop it here and now or Zoah would be reduced 
            to nothing but ash! As it launched up into the sky, the dragon and 
            I attacked the hell out of the thing. It was reduced to its simplest 
            form, the main warhead. A final blast from the dragon's Armageddon 
            berserk technique, finally took the menacing thing down. It was just 
            in the nick of time too! If we had spend any more time trying to stop 
            the thing, it would have been too late. It felt like a heavy weight 
            had been lifted off of my shoulders, Zoah and all of its people were 
            now safe. We left the heavily damaged Imperial Air Force Post, and 
            headed back to the Village of Zoah, to tell Vaiman the good news.</font></p>

            press start and go into your player menu, enter &quot;Select Dragon 
            Type&quot; and change your dragon into Spiritual form. Now, there 
            is a little trick that is very helpful to know. Note, the analog Saturn 
            controller is needed for this. By pressing the analog stick right 
            slightly, and lightly, your spiritual gauge will fill up. Try to get 
            it to 200. By pressing the analog stick down slightly and lightly, 
            your agility gauge will fill up. Try to get it to 197 or somewhere 
            in the 190s range. If you are successful in pulling this off, as seen 
            above, your berserk attacks will take more damage and your gauges 
            will fill up faster, speeding up your dragon's movement around the 
            enemy in the process. The result is an almost equal combination of 
            Spiritual form and Agility form, with the Spiritual form being more 
            dominant. Try this process out for the other forms, to get similar 
            effects. </font></p>

          <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="4"><strong>3.</strong> Another 
            extremely helpful tip to know, is how to refill your BP without having 
            to waste items. Note, you have to be in Spiritual form for this to 
            happen. When fighting the Patrol Group, Stingers, Missile Cruiser, 
            and Plasma Cannon you can do just that. When fighting these enemies, 
            if you're low on BP, stay in the green safe zones and let your three 
            gauges fill up. When all three are completely filled, your BP will 
            gradually increase, allowing you to fill it back up to the max, as 
            long as you stay in the green safe zones. This allows you to save 
            your items for the more important boss fights, very convenient. Make 
            good use of it.</font></p>
