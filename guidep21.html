          <p><strong><font color="#000000" size="6">The Guardian Fire Shows the 
            Way to Mel-Kava</font></strong></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">After having completely decimated 
            the Imperial Air Force Post, I returned to the Holy District to go 
            tell Vaiman the good news. As I entered the Holy District, I overheard 
            another conversation from the mother and daughter sitting near the 
            storehouse. They talked about how Bezer wouldn't return to the Holy 
            district and the fact that Quitor is selling provisions from the forest, 
            to outsiders. Next, I entered the storehouse and intuitively listened 
            as Boaz explained the village code to me. He told me that children 
            have to be approved by the Council. All others are banished from Zoah 
            to survive on their own, in the outside world. It was the villages 
            way to control the population. How horrible, I thought to myself. 
            As I left the storehouse, I noticed Paet standing outside by the church. 
            he didn't look like he was in a very good mood. He told me Vaiman 
            was inside. He was sure that his father was up to no good. I proceeded 
            to enter the church. Upon entering, I listened to a long conversation 
            between Damon the High Priest and Vaiman, about the situation the 
            village is trying to overcome, involving the Empire's invasion and 
            occupation of Zoah. Ultimately, Vaiman was blinded by my dragon's 
            power and believed the Empire would no longer be of any threat to 
            the village. The two men soon became aware of my presence. I quickly 
            told them I'd been successful in destroying the Empires base. Vaiman 
            was ecstatic with laughter. His disgusting fat jiggled around, as 
            he jumped up and down. Damon soon left infatuated with anger. Vaiman 
            explained to me that he undoubtedly would be elected the next High 
            Priest, and that I should go see him the next day, for my reward. 
            I left with thoughts of the reward on my mind. As I walked around 
            the village, I just couldn't wait, so I hurried over to Vaiman's house 
            to ask him if I could have the reward a little early. When I entered 
            his room, he was busy talking things over with Quitor. After talking 
            to him a couple of times, he gave me 500 Dynes as an incentive to 
            leave him alone, for the time being. I would definitely have to wait 
            until the next day, Vaiman was just too busy. To pass some time, I 
            thought it a good idea to go over and see how Paet was doing. I hurried 
            to the back of town and of course, found Paet working on his airship. 
            He uttered something about a letter made out to me. He soon handed 
            me the letter and when I read it, I was surprised to find that someone 
            wanted to meet me in this exact location, during the night. I wondered 
            who it could be? Paet thought it was probably someone I knew. But 
            who? I wandered around the village, waiting for the sky to fill with 
            the gentle light of the stars. When night was upon the village, I 
            quickly headed over to Paet's work area. A man stepped out from the 
            shadows. It was Craymen! I immediately attempted to end his life, 
            by firing my gun directly at his head. Before I could fire, my gun 
            was quickly shot out of my hand! A deadly silence ensued. Craymen 
            then explained to me his intentions and motivations. He planned to 
            save the world from extinction and to do so he needed the key element, 
            Azel. He had to be ruthless, and that is why he killed all of my friends. 
            &quot;This is war,&quot; he said. His actions were still unacceptable, 
            I would never forgive him for the atrocious acts he committed. He 
            continued to tell me that the Empire hadn't given up yet, so he had 
            come to ask for my help. Before I could even comprehend an answer 
            to that question, I was shot at from above. With adrenaline pumping 
            through my body, I evaded the gunfire. I somehow came away with my 
            life intact. It was that bastard Zastava! He soon descended in his 
            flying machine, and both him and Craymen made their escape. I had 
            just lost my chance for revenge! I wondered if I would ever get another 
            chance. Paet jumped down from above. He had been watching the whole 
            thing, hidden in the shadows. &quot;I let them get away! I bet they 
            S#!t a brick,&quot; he said. His comical routine didn't overshadow 
            the fact that the man I'd been chasing all this time, just slipped 
            through my fingers. He asked me what was wrong. I told him it was 
            nothing. Morning soon arrived and I made my way over to Vaiman's house, 
            to claim my reward. He rewarded me with the Temple Key. With this 
            I would be able to enter the sanctuary within the church, wherein 
            the Guardian Fire could be found. Before leaving, I talked to Vaiman 
            once more. He made me an offer. It was an offer for me to become guardian 
            of Zoah. I told him I couldn't give that kind of commitment at the 
            moment, and turned him down three times. After he threatened to make 
            a deal with the Empire, saying he would give them valuable information 
            about my dragon, I had no choice but to reconsider. I guess it couldn't 
            be helped with a greedy, power hungry man such as Vaiman. As my eyes 
            angrily wondered, I noticed he had many different kinds of books on 
            his bookshelf, he said I could keep one of the books titled, Dragon 
            Report. With no respect for the way he had acted, I left his estate 
            and walked back to the church, in the blackness of night. I used the 
            Temple Key and entered the sanctuary. Inside I found the Guardian 
            Fire, a relic that protected the town form monsters with its mystical 
            white light. When I examined the relic, everything turned pure white, 
            and I was shown a vision of Mel-Kava and the Tower, just north of 
            Zoah. Paet, upon having seen the light change from outside the church, 
            immediately entered the room and said I had been covered with light 
            while I was touching the relic. When he touched it, nothing happened. 
            He needed more time to examine and acquire information about the relic. 
            He said to come back later. When I reentered the sanctuary, he gave 
            me a report named after him called, Paet's Report. It contained information 
            on how to destroy Mel-Kava. After reading the report I discovered 
            that: Mel-Kava uses a pair of engines to fly, these engines need to 
            be destroyed, the path to these engines are blocked by crawling guardians, 
            the destruction of Mel-Kava lies within, Mel-Kava emits energy particles 
            that would even be capable of pushing my dragon back, the ship will 
            become unstable if I destroy the exhaust ports atop Mel-Kava, and 
            there supposedly is a device that can protect me from the particles 
            pouring endlessly out of the ships engine. With this vital information 
            in hand, I headed out to destroy Mel-Kava and have the path to the 
            Tower revealed once and for all!</font></p>
