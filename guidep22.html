          <p><strong><font color="#000000" size="6">&quot;God's Carriage&quot;</font></strong></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">As I drew closer to the massive ship 
            Mel-Kava, I could see that it was just as big as Vaiman's ass! It 
            deserved to be destroyed! Advancing further towards the ship, lead 
            us into a sequence of battles against Ancient Age Monsters. After 
            the battles, we arrived at Mel-Kava's bottom. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">To demolish this thing, I knew I would 
            have to attack it from the inside. Energy particles spewed out of 
            the left and right exhaust ports, located to the far back of the ship. 
            I had the dragon quickly lock-on and destroy them. Moving along Mel-Kava's 
            bottom, soon brought us to an impassable barrier. A monster soon descended 
            from above and lowered itself within the protection of a barrier. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">None of our attacks were sufficient 
            enough to break through the barrier, so we retreated. There had to 
            be a way to shut the force field off. We found an opening above us 
            and immediately flew inside Mel-Kava. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Once inside, a long corridor with 
            strange doors awaited us. After passing through two of the strange 
            doors, we had to fight a spider-like monster. After it was defeated, 
            we made our way into a yellow door, located at the end of the corridor. 
            Inside, we found the reactor that was supposedly providing power to 
            the impassible barrier. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">We destroyed it's central core, causing 
            the reactor to explode. We then proceeded to head back to Mel-Kava's 
            bottom, and found that the reactor was indeed providing power to the 
            barrier. It was now down! The monster from before descended once more, 
            this time without the protection of the barrier. The dragon destroyed 
            it with ease!</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">As we flew further north, the dragon 
            and I were caught up in giant mechanical arms and shot up into another 
            section deep inside Mel-Kava. We flew through the many corridors, 
            fighting some more of those spider-like monsters along the way. An 
            elevator brought us up to a second level. At the end of this second 
            level, we stumbled upon Mel-Kava's central reactor. It was emitting 
            light particles. As long as we stayed under the surrounding platforms, 
            we were shielded from them, and had no problems destroying the spinning 
            mechanism atop the reactor. Once the spinning mechanism was destroyed, 
            the entire reactor went along with it. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">After it was destroyed, we ascended 
            to an area above. The ship was still emitting light particles! I thought 
            I had destroyed it's one and only power source. Directly in front 
            of us was another type of reactor, a giant one at that! I knew taking 
            down this ship wasn't going to be that easy.</font><font color="#000000" size="5"> 
            It took a while, but with multiple shots from the dragon's lock-on 
            lasers, it was soon destroyed. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">We then flew above to Mel-Kava's deck. 
            By destroying the reactor below, we eliminated one set of exhaust 
            ports located on the left and right sides of the deck. There were 
            ten exhaust ports, and four more reactors left. Every time we destroyed 
            a set of two exhaust ports on the left and right sides, the corresponding 
            reactor below, would also be destroyed. When the final two exhaust 
            ports located at the far end were destroyed, a path leading deeper 
            inside Mel-Kava was revealed. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">As we entered a new area, I stopped 
            a moment to ponder why the ship was still flying. I mean I had just 
            destroyed six reactors! What more did I need to do?! The area I found 
            myself in looked familiar. It was a second reactor! This had to be 
            the final one. Destroying it would have to take the ship down! </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Surrounding the reactor, was a group 
            of Mel-Kava's reactor guardians. Shooting them in the neck was the 
            only way to destroy them. They also had to be destroyed due to the 
            massive amount of energy particles they were emitting. When each one 
            was destroyed, a platform lowered down in their place. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">With the guardians destroyed, we positioned 
            ourselves over one of the platforms and began our assault on the spinning 
            mechanism located above the reactor. It was easily destroyed, with 
            the dragon's lock-on lasers. The reactor exploded, shooting thick 
            streams of light every which way. With the destruction of the second 
            reactor, came Mel-Kava's downfall. We had succeeded in destroying 
            &quot;Gods Carriage&quot;, and the fog it once created soon dissipated. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">The path to the Tower was finally 
            revealed to us! Azel soon came to greet us, but not in such a nice 
            manner. She wanted to kill us again of course, and I had no choice 
            but to fight her yet again for the... How many times was it again? 
            Oh, forget it I've lost track! I had to find a way to take down Atolm 
            without hurting her. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">I just barely succeeded in coming 
            out of the battle alive. Azel and Atolm weren't so lucky and proceeded 
            to fall to their deaths. I had but one chance to save her! The dragon 
            dived downward, and before I could begin to comprehend how I was going 
            to catch her, Atolm, her dragon, surrounded her with a force field 
            and she landed gently into my arms. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Soon after, I departed for Zoah and 
            came to the realization that the Empire had gotten their before me! 
            I watched in horror as they shot a destructive beam of light directly 
            at the Village. Zoah was turned into the blackest ash. Everyone was 
            dead! I couldn't except what had just happened! I had no choice but 
            to retreat for the time being. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">I brought Azel to safety and set up 
            camp. She was unconscious and was unresponsive. It looked like I would 
            have to fight the Empire alone. Before heading off to the Imperial 
            Air Force Base, I decided to explore Georgius. Maybe I would find 
            a source of great power to unleash upon the Empire, just maybe...</font></p>
