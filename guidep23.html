          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Searching the area surrounding the 
            ancient ship at Georgius, we found four identical pyramids. When activated, 
            spheres of energy poured out of them and into the back of the ship. 
            When the fourth pyramid was destroyed, the energy spheres that poured 
            out of it pulled us towards the ship. It was evident that we were 
            near the ships entrance, so we entered its depths to explore further. 
            Inside the vast corridor within, we flew past a giant door. As we 
            entered into the next section, three streams of blinding light rushed 
            forward manifesting into a dragon, right in front of our eyes! It 
            seemed the dragon spirit wanted us to follow it, so we did just that! 
            The corridor seemed to stretch on for an eternity. The ghostly dragon 
            disappeared behind a final green door. When we opened this door, we 
            were drawn into a portal of green light. It was amazing! When we emerged, 
            we found ourselves in a large chamber. Within this chamber was a giant 
            dragon crest. The spirit of the dragon we followed, was nowhere to 
            be found. My dragon accessed the dragon crest, turned it into pure 
            energy, and drew it into its body for storage. Upon doing so, a strange 
            creature emerged from the crest. I had no idea what it was! To me, 
            it looked as if it was the spirit of that dragon, reincarnated into 
            a baby dragon pup. But it's just my crazy theory. The little guy immediately 
            took a liking to my dragon, and it flew beside us willingly. It wouldn't 
            leave our side. Astoundingly, it mimicked my dragon's moves, and pulled 
            off a few tricks of its own! We left the chamber and headed back down 
            the long corridor, returning outside. It was time to put this ancient 
            ship to rest. Located on the side of the ship, were its engine rudders. 
            We proceeded to destroy them, one by one. The dragon's lasers made 
            quick work of them. After they fell apart into the water below, a 
            long stream of energy from inside the ship, reached out and grabbed 
            us! We had no way of freeing ourselves, we were within its grasp! 
            We were then dragged to the back of the ship, where even more energy 
            streams latched on to my dragon. The energy streams flung us around 
            violently! The ship was making one final attempt to stop us from bringing 
            forth its downfall. The dragon, with great effort, managed to break 
            down the beams one after the other, until their grip weakened and 
            they were no more. Once all of its defensive beams were destroyed, 
            the ship self-destructed. It fell to its final resting place, below 
            the shadowy water. The ship was gone, and a new ally was gained. I 
            wondered how this little guy, could be of any help to us, but I guess, 
            he was trying it's best. The three of us rested up at camp. The next 
            day, we made way for the Imperial Air Force Base, to show the Empire 
            we didn't take the complete obliteration of Zoah and its people, lightly!</font></p>
