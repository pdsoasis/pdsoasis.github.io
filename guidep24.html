            Force </font></strong></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">In pursuit of the Empire, we found 
            ourselves over their Imperial Air Force Post. The Empire had us right 
            where they wanted us. We soon headed into wave after wave of battles. 
            We fought many battleships, taking them all out one after the other. 
            Inevitably we made our way to the Empires Flagship, the one that decimated 
            Zoah. We managed to take heavy damage to the ship, only to have it 
            completely repair and restore the damage we dealt to it. Before we 
            knew it, we were engulfed within a massive cannon blast! The dragon's 
            shield barely held up as we were flung around the sky. Soon after, 
            Craymen's Fleet unexpectedly arrived, to do battle with the Imperial 
            Flagship. Zastava flew before us, to greet us with a death threat. 
            The dragon quickly shut him up, with an onslaught of Armageddon berserk 
            blasts. After the battle, he told us that Craymen was waiting for 
            us at the Tower, and that we should meet him there. He then proceeded 
            to fly off, ultimately in the end, surrendering his life to the Empires 
            Flagship. We headed back to camp and surprisingly, found a letter 
            by Azel's still unconscious body. I wondered who it could be from? 
            Closely examining the letter, I found Craymen's insignia. It was from 
            Zastava and Craymen. The first part of the letter was scribbled by 
            Zastava. He said his dying wish was for me to meet with Craymen at 
            the Tower. He ended his thoughts by saying, &quot;The two of you can 
            save this world.&quot; The second half of the letter was written by 
            Craymen. He thanked me for saving Azel twice. He ranted on about her 
            being too complex for me to fully understand, and if I didn't return 
            her, she would never regain consciousness. He ended his thoughts by 
            saying, &quot;Come to the Tower with Azel. The gateway will be open 
            for you.&quot; After reading the letter, I headed for the Tower to 
            meet my destiny.</font></p>
