          <p><strong><font color="#000000" size="6">To Fulfill Ones Destiny In

          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">As I entered the Tower with Azel in 
            my arms, Craymen's voice echoed throughout the room, saying, &quot;Place 
            Azel in that compartment.&quot; I wondered where his voice was coming 
            from. A compartment lay before me, I placed Azel in it. It soon ascended 
            upward. Craymen then said, &quot;Step onto the light.&quot; A ball 
            of light soon appeared, making a platform for me to step onto. When 
            I stepped onto the flat disc of energy, it began to move forward. 
            I passed through a corridor full of dormant Ancient Age monsters. 
            I soon arrived at Craymen's location. Craymen and I had a long conversation. 
            As we rode on energy discs throughout a long corridor, I noticed we 
            were underwater, near Uru. A strange white eel swam by. Craymen told 
            me that the Towers main function was to create a habitable environment 
            for an already dead planet. He also said that the monsters are caretakers 
            of the ecosystem and protect mankind from extinction. As we continued 
            on throughout the long corridor, he explained the Empires endless 
            cycle of war and death. &quot; Even if the Tower restores the world, 
            the humans will just consume and destroy it again. Someone, or something, 
            must take control of everything, or we shall continue to destroy ourselves 
            forever,&quot; he said. We arrived in a room where Azel was being 
            kept safe, inside her compartment. Craymen continued to tell me that 
            Azel was created as a weapon, made to infiltrate a Tower and destroy 
            it from within. Before he could say anything more, the room soon shook 
            violently. It was the Empire! They were now inside the Tower, trying 
            to gain access to its secrets. There was no one left to stop them. 
            &quot;You...are our only hope,&quot; Craymen said. I asked him what 
            he wanted me to do. &quot;Nothing...I merely set the stage. You must 
            fulfill your own destiny, in your own way,&quot; he said. I intended 
            to stop them, but I made sure Craymen knew that I still hadn't forgiven 
            him yet. I departed with my dragon and rode an elevator deep inside 
            the Tower, in pursuit of the Empire. The elevator brought the dragon 
            and I to Tower 1F North. Craymen's voice echoed once more, saying, 
            &quot;The Imperials are already invading the top of the Tower, and 
            They're heading for the control area..&quot; I told him that we would 
            finish things, when I return. He looked forward to seeing me return 
            safely. I soon arrived at the bottom floors of the Tower. Craymen 
            proceeded to tell me that the Tower consists of vast areas connected 
            by gates. He then told me to fly to the top. The gate to the shortest 
            route was already open. The dragon and I flew upward and found the 
            Gate Craymen was talking about. We entered the Gate and entered Tower 
            4F. Moving directly forward, brought us into a chamber full of item 
            containers. There was also a switch in the center of the room. I made 
            sure not to touch it, as I didn't want to wake up the Tower. Moving 
            further along the corridor, we ran into the Imperial Forces. It was 
            the first battle out of five, we would have with them. The first sequence 
            of Imperial battles was over fairly quickly, thanks to the dragon's 
            firepower. As I continued down the corridor of Tower 4F, we found 
            the Tower Field Map, a map of the Tower. It was quite handy. It helped 
            me navigate through the many corridors of the Tower. I soon rode an 
            elevator to Tower 5F. Moving through another corridor, we had to fight 
            the Imperial Forces once more. After the battle, we found an eastern 
            most chamber with another set of item containers. After acquiring 
            the items, we made our way out of the corridor and into Tower- Hangar 
            # 1. The Imperial Forces were much faster than I had expected. There 
            was just too many of them. Craymen's voice echoed yet again, telling 
            me that the Imperial Troops had already invaded the upper floors of 
            the Tower. My main objective was to destroy their Transport Ship. 
            I had to do all of the work, while Craymen just sat back and watched!&quot;I 
            want to fight...But it would be in vain, you're my only hope now,&quot; 
            he said. I paid no attention to his pointless ranting. After the conversation 
            with Craymen, I made my way to the upper most gate, to Tower 6F, and 
            rode an elevator to Tower 8F North Passage. I then proceeded past 
            an inner passage to Tower 8F West Passage, and rode another elevator 
            to Tower 9F West Passage. After moving through another inner passage, 
            I arrived at Tower 9F East Passage. It was here that the dragon and 
            I were engaged by the Imperial Forces, for the third time. After making 
            quick work of them, we arrived at Tower 11F, and had to face the the 
            last two waves of the Imperial bastards. They just kept coming! After 
            the tiring battles, we found ourselves in Tower - Hangar # 2. We continued 
            upward and entered another gate. We were now at Tower 12F. Another 
            elevator at the end of the corridor, took us to Tower 13F. We proceeded 
            down another long corridor, and exited to the upper floors of the 
            Tower. Craymen's voice echoed, &quot; That's the top of the Tower. 
            The presence of the Transport Ship was verified. This is it.&quot; 
            This was now my chance to rid the world of the Empire! I was almost 
            there, just a little higher. The dragon flew upward until we could 
            see the exit. We were stopped in our tracks by the Empires Transport 
            Ship. The dragon fought a fierce battle against the massive machine, 
            and came out victorious. After having destroyed the Transport Ship, 
            I made my way on foot, to the control area of the Tower. Therein, 
            I found Azel. &quot;It's a trap,&quot; she yelled. It was too late. 
            I was in the Emperor's hands. Craymen lay bound on the cold ground, 
            and nothing but Imperial soldiers surrounded us. Then, out of nowhere, 
            Craymen made an attempt to kill the Emperor! Sadly, he failed and 
            was gunned down by none other than the Emperor himself. He demanded 
            Azel open the gate. Azel screamed as Craymen lay unconscious, and 
            the Tower began to activate itself. Things turned out for the worse, 
            for the Empire, as a giant monster fell from above! The Emperor got 
            what he deserved, a giant blade through his body! Surrounding soldiers 
            also had their lives taken from them in an instant. I had to fight 
            for my life, as I tried to protect Craymen and Azel from harm. I fired 
            my gun constantly. The laser fire was just deflected. Then the unthinkable 
            happened, I failed in my attempt to protect Craymen. He was killed 
            by the monster, a blade through his body, just like the Emperor. Not 
            a fitting way to go. Azel soon fainted and I caught her in my arms, 
            continuing my assault on the monster. I finally managed to subdue 
            the horrible creature and with Azel, I quickly made my escape, thanks 
            to my dragon. As we flew off into the distance, I could see a massive 
            swarm of monsters emerge from the depths of the Tower. Hordes of monsters 
            destroyed the Imperial fleet stationed nearby, and infested the Flagship 
            Grig Orig. There was nothing more I could do. We flew to safety.</font></p>
