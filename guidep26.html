            Seekers' Stronghold</font></p>
          <p><strong><font color="#000000" size="6">The Ghosts of the Ancient 
            Ones </font></strong></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Seeking a place of refuge, from the 
            horrible hordes of monsters, I headed on over to the caravan. When 
            I arrived, Raul told me a seeker was awaiting my arrival, and wanted 
            to meet me. As I walked towards the back of the caravan, I spotted 
            Jephthah, waiting by one of the wagons. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">I told him I was surprised he survived 
            the attack on Zoah. He said he had come to the caravan to find me 
            and gave me a message from Gash. He wanted me to meet him at the Seekers' 
            Stronghold. I had never heard of such a place. &quot;Not many people 
            have,&quot; Jephthah said. He then handed me a Seeker Map, showing 
            the location of the Seekers' Stronghold. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">I immediately departed, to go meet 
            Gash. Upon arriving at the stronghold, Gash told me that he needed 
            to make accommodations for Azel. The seekers were going to try and 
            awaken her. I agreed to hand over Azel to their care. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Gash then told me to meet him at the 
            clearing within the stronghold, for he had something he needed to 
            tell me. I proceeded to exit the cave we were in, and found myself 
            just outside the stronghold. It was a wondrous place. Just behind 
            the stronghold, was a giant waterfall! The massive stone beam I was 
            standing on, was one out of many, that amazingly, held the stronghold 
            up in the air. Each stone beam lead into a series of caves. I ran 
            along the first stone beam, and entered the stronghold. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">I couldn't believe my eyes, Paet was 
            standing before me, having a conversation with a female seeker named 
            Rhagg. Standing far away, I eavesdropped on their conversation. The 
            female seeker wanted Paet to join them. Paet refused her offer. Upon 
            talking to him, he told me he had escaped in his airship, but it crashed 
            shortly after. The seekers found him alive, and took him with them. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">He still couldn't get over the fact 
            that Zoah was now in ruins. &quot;Guarded by the Gods...My ass,&quot; 
            he said. I told him it wasn't his fault. I said I would talk to him 
            later, and walked through two large double doors, leading into the 
            upper floor clearing. I saw Gash over in the corner. I decided I would 
            first take a tour of the stronghold, before talking to him. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">First, I entered a purple door, to 
            the left of the two double doors. Inside, I came face to face with 
            Jared, the shop owner from Zoah. He had also survived the attack! 
            While talking to him, he explained that he was also a seeker, and 
            had been keeping a close watch over me, due to Gash's instruction. 
            After talking to him again, he told me he had upgraded Radgam's Large 
            Gun, and gave me an Assassin gun part. Before leaving, I bought a 
            Pulverizer gun part, for the high price of 30,000 dynes. It was worth 
            it, because this gun part packed the most firepower I had ever seen! 
            </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Second, I entered a green door. I 
            found myself in a grand library consisting of various books about 
            the Ancient Age. I met a seeker called Zadoc, the compiler. He said 
            he had been studying the Ancient Age, and gave me a book called Old 
            Diary. It was the diary of the last dragon rider, and he said I should 
            have it. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Soon after, I examined the bookshelf 
            directly above Zadoc. I found a book about the Tower, called Tower 
            Report 3. Zadoc gladly let me keep it. I then asked him about the 
            Town of Zoah. He said he had researched the Guardian Fire. There was 
            an ancient record of a similar find, he explained to me. Zadoc then 
            gave me a book called, Memory Report. I exited the room. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Lastly, I entered a red door, the 
            last door on the upper floor. Inside, was a type of medical room containing 
            an ancient relic, that was treating Azel. I wondered how it worked. 
            I also met a mute girl named Shella. There was not much I could do 
            for Azel, so I let her be. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">I then walked down a ramp that lead 
            to the bottom floor. There was another series of doors for me to enter 
            and explore. First, I entered another purple door, located to the 
            left of the ramp. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Once inside, standing far away, I 
            eavesdropped on a conversation between two seekers. They soon noticed 
            my presence and introduced themselves. Simeon, a quester, welcomed 
            me to their village. Next, Reuben, an apprentice quester, introduced 
            himself. He was glad to know my dragon was friendly after all. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Second, I entered another green door. 
            This room contained more medical devices. There was not much else 
            to see, so I left the room. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Third, I entered two red double doors 
            and found myself outside the stronghold, along another stone beam. 
            I ran along the beam and entered another cave. This cave contained 
            another relic. It had been modified quite a bit, by one of the seekers. 
            I didn't want to mess with it, so I quickly left. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Fourth, I moved up a set of stairs 
            leading up to a red door. I was soon introduced to Ladha, the guardian. 
            She told me not to worry about Azel, for she would surely wake up 
            soon. I thanked her for her kindness, and moved on to the next door. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Fifth, just to the left of Ladha's 
            room, I entered another red door. Upon entering, I met another quester 
            named Perez. He said the seeker way of life was new to him, and he 
            still hadn't finished his training. He also wondered what it was like 
            to ride my dragon. He said, &quot; Let me ride him one of these days.&quot; 
            I quickly left the room. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Sixth, before going back up the ramp, 
            I entered another purple door just beside it. Inside, I found a strange 
            shrine made of wood and monster shells. I had no idea what it was 
            for. It kind of gave me an eerie feeling, so I didn't stay inside 
            the room for too long. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Lastly, directly north of the purple 
            door, I entered the last red door on the bottom floor. I was outside 
            the stronghold once again, along another set of stone beams. This 
            time, I had a choice between an upper path and a lower path. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">The upper path lead to a door that 
            was apparently locked, so I entered the bottom door. This door lead 
            inside another cave, and Bezer was inside it, along with the airship 
            he and Paet escaped in. I guess it really did come in handy. Bezer 
            wasn't so happy to see me, and asked me why I didn't save Zoah. He 
            said I deserted the town. I hastily explained to him, I was a hunter 
            in the wrong place at the wrong time. After the uncomfortable conversation, 
            he told me to leave him alone. Before I departed, he said he was going 
            to live on his own, without anyone's help. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">I had explored the entire stronghold, 
            so it was time to walk back up the ramp to the upper floor clearing, 
            and go see what Gash had to tell me. As we walked throughout the stronghold, 
            I asked Gash about the monsters and the Imperial Fleet. He said not 
            to worry, his men were in position. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">He continued to say, that the seekers 
            lead people to believe they were just a bunch of tomb raiders. Gash 
            was their new leader. He lifted up his mask and revealed to me his 
            identity. I was immediately surprised. We soon entered the room where 
            I had seen that strange modified relic. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Inside, Gash explained to me who the 
            seekers really were, as well as their true purpose. Their only purpose 
            was to completely destroy the Tower, that which controls the world 
            and mankind's destiny. &quot;I'm sick of being kept alive by the ghosts 
            of the ancient ones,&quot; He said. Gash then pleaded with me to aid 
            the seekers cause, and destroy the Uru Tower, with the help of my 
            dragon and Azel. &quot;The Divine Visitor is the dragon itself,&quot; 
            he exclaimed. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">I agreed to help him. He then told 
            me to seek the fine details from Zadoc, the compiler. I headed over 
            to the vast library of ancient knowledge, to ask Zadoc how I would 
            go about destroying the Tower. He said Azel's true purpose was to 
            open the path to Sestren, a living network that controlled all Towers. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Sestren could be found within a group 
            of astral passages beyond the human world. If Sestren were to be destroyed, 
            all the active Towers would be no more. With this vital knowledge, 
            I went to check up on Azel, in the medical room. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">As I entered, I found Gash already 
            inside. It wasn't too long before she awoke from her nightmare. It 
            was the first time she had experienced a dream. Before we could say 
            anything more, a fellow seeker barged into the room, to warn us of 
            impending danger. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Monsters and the infested Grig Orig 
            were heading directly for the stronghold! Gash immediately rushed 
            off to the observation deck. I knew he must be going to that locked 
            door, just above Bezer's location. Before departing, Azel asked me 
            for my name. &quot;I'm Edge,&quot; I said. I quickly ran out of the 
            room. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">On my way to the observation deck, 
            I ran into Perez and Rhagg. They were talking about a shrine, surrounded 
            by four ruins, found in the Forest of Zoah. I had no time to listen 
            in further. I soon arrived at the observation deck. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Gash was at the lookout post, observing 
            the infested Grig Orig's movements. Everyone on the ship was being 
            eaten alive! It was out of control, and was drawing closer to the 
            stronghold. Unexpectedly, a blast of energy from the ship landed a 
            direct blow near the observation deck! It had to be stopped. Gash 
            was confident that I was the man for the job. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Before exiting the stronghold, I went 
            to find Paet, to warn him of the immediate danger. I found him observing 
            the modified relic. He told me that Bezer had taken the airship and 
            left. He wanted to get away from all of the fighting. Bezer had made 
            a reckless move. It was just too dangerous on his own, but I had no 
            time to go and assure his safety. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">At the exit of the stronghold, I eavesdropped 
            on a conversation between Azel and Shella. Shella actually spoke to 
            Azel! I told Azel I would be leaving, to the Forest of Zoah, and quickly 
            departed. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Night soon arrived, and I wouldn't 
            be able to fight Grig Orig effectively, so I stayed at the caravan 
            for the night. During the bitter cold night, I found An'jou sitting 
            by the fire. He had returned from his fruitless journey without the 
            Tobitama Rock, and was glad to see that I was the one to save Enkak's 
            life. He showed his gratitude by giving me a Berserk Vampire gun part, 
            the most valuable item in the caravan. In the morning I departed for 
            the Forest of Zoah, to put an end to the infested Grig Orig.</font></p>
