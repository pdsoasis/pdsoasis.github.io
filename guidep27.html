          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Before leaving the Seekers' Stronghold, 
            Zadoc told me that it wouldn't be so easy to reach Grig Orig from 
            the forest. The Arangata were tightening their defenses and would 
            surely stand in my way. The creatures were rooting themselves in the 
            forest. In order to destroy them I would first have to attack their 
            roots, to weaken them. As the dragon and I flew above the forest, 
            we could see the infested Grig Orig in the distance. I had to fight 
            my way north. I would avenge Zoah! Both Ancient Age machines and Arangata, 
            surrounded the forest canopy. As we encountered one of the Arangata, 
            we were immediately blown back by a strong winded tornado. I had no 
            choice but to take Zadoc's advice, and find the roots of these terribly 
            strong monsters. We entered a nearby cocoon. It lead below the Forest 
            of Zoah. The once lush forest was now turning to ash! Everything was 
            ablaze. We had to stop Grig Orig at all costs, or the forest would 
            be completely burned to the ground. While exploring the bottom of 
            the forest, we eventually stumbled upon what looked like an Arangata 
            root. It was surrounded by a force field that feed the monster energy. 
            The dragon quickly deactivated it and the root soon shriveled up. 
            As we searched for the remaining roots, we found a northern ruin with 
            a mysteriously locked door. The dragon wasn't strong enough to open 
            it, so we left it alone, intending to come back at a later time. Throughout 
            the forest, we found a total of eight roots. Each one, we deactivated 
            with no trouble. Once all of the roots were taken care of, we reentered 
            one of the large cocoons surrounding us, and returned to the forest 
            canopy. Above the forest, we then fought a series of battles against 
            all eight Arangata. They were now defenseless and open to attack. 
            We soon destroyed each and every one of them. After the sequence of 
            battles we pressed on towards the infested Grig Orig. It was worse 
            than I thought. The ship was completely infested with monsters and 
            looked horrible. The dragon and I had no choice but to put an end 
            to its chaotic rain over the forest. After the battle, we left the 
            forest and returned to the Seekers' Stronghold. The aftermath of Grig 
            Orig, was sure to be a tremendous loss for the seekers.</font></p>
