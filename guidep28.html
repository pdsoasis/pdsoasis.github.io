            Stronghold Visit 2</font></p>
          <p><strong><font color="#000000" size="6">Azel's Disappearance</font></strong></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Upon returning to the Seekers' Stronghold, 
            it was quite clear that the seekers had suffered great loses. Bodies 
            wrapped in blankets, were strung out on the cold floor, near the entrance 
            of the stronghold. Even more surprising, Ladha told me that Azel was 
            gone! </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">As I made my way to the upper floor 
            clearing, I ran into Gash. He asked me if I had heard about Azel's 
            disappearance. I answered yes. He said it was all his fault, since 
            he had been gone. I asked him, where in the world could she have run 
            off to? </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">He told me she was the key that opens 
            the Tower, and that she most certainly knew we wanted to go there. 
            I told him I'd go look for her as soon as possible. While on the upper 
            floor, I checked up on Jared and restocked on supplies. He was busy 
            making antidotes for the injured seekers. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Moving down to the lower floor, I 
            noticed part of the cave wall was partially destroyed, blocking the 
            way to the grain storeroom. Rhagg told me to look around, they had 
            taken quite a beating. &quot;I guess Azel figured out why we were 
            protecting her,&quot; she said. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Next, I found Paet in Simeon and Reuben's 
            room. &quot;I almost got killed out there,&quot; he exclaimed. He 
            told me he never knew how dangerous the monsters could be. He had 
            seen the monsters many times with his Geo-Scan photographs, but never 
            up close and personal. I asked him what he was going to do now. He 
            said he didn't know, since he had never been outside of Zoah before. 
            I made the suggestion to join the seekers. He immediately refused. 
            I told him he and the seekers were alike, both driven from their lands. 
            And of course, I told him he was highly skilled and could help many 
            people. The seekers were surely aware of his potential, I said. He 
            eventually agreed with me and started to perk up. I said good-bye 
            and left him in peace. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">I then found Simeon and Reuben in 
            the spare medical room. Eavesdropping on their conversation, I learned 
            that Reuben had failed his first mission. He lay injured on a medical 
            bed. Simeon couldn't believe that Azel was gone. I still couldn't 
            put my finger on where exactly, Azel could have went, so I went to 
            have a talk with Zadoc. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">He told me she was probably headed 
            for Uru. He went on to tell me that Uru was the origin of our world, 
            and the homeland of the drones. He was talking about the drone plant, 
            found below the Underground Ruins of Uru. She had to have gone there! 
            I thanked him for his help, and immediately departed for the Underground 
            Ruins of Uru to find Azel.</font></p>
