            Ruins of Uru Final Visit</font></p>
          <p><strong><font color="#000000" size="6">The Homeland of the Drones</font></strong></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Taking Zadoc's advice, I headed to 
            the Underground Ruins of Uru, to search for Azel. After exploring 
            the entire facility, there was only one place left to look. I headed 
            for the Underground Dome, and proceeded to B2F North. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Inside, I found a series of six information 
            relics. Each one, gave me valuable information about the origin of 
            the D units I had been collecting, as well as the creation of Azel. 
            The D Units in fact, were part of a renegade project, called the Light 
            Wing project. The project was terminated, but before termination, 
            the scientists decided to scatter the project across the continent 
            into twelve pieces, called D Units. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">The Light Wing, I learned, was also 
            supposed to be the ultimate form of my dragon. Amazing! If I were 
            to find all twelve D Units, I may just be able to see my dragon's 
            ultimate form! </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Lastly, I learned that during Azel's 
            creation, her life span was manipulated, allowing her to live for 
            thousands of years, she may even be immortal for all I know. Apparently, 
            before she could be completed, she was stolen during an attack on 
            the facility. I had learned a great deal, but my search for Azel was 
            not over. I pressed on. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">I found Azel in the northern most 
            chamber on B2F North. She was surrounded by mutants! The dragon and 
            I quickly defeated them and retreated with Azel, to camp. At camp, 
            I asked Azel if she was born at the Underground Ruins of Uru. She 
            told me she was not born, but created. I also asked her various questions 
            about the Tower, Sestren, and Craymen. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">The Tower couldn't be stopped from 
            our current position, we had to go inside. Then, Azel would be able 
            to synchronize with it, opening the way to Sestren. When I asked about 
            Sestren, she had heard the name, but didn't know any details. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">I also told her I was sorry about 
            Craymen's death. He was my enemy, but honestly, I didn't know anymore. 
            So many people died during those battles. Back at the Seekers' Stronghold 
            Camp, Azel assured me that she wouldn't run away again. That was a 
            relief! It was time to enter the Seekers' Stronghold, and attend the 
            funeral ceremony.</font></p>
