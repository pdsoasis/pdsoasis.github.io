            Stronghold Final Visit</font></p>

          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">After talking to Ladha, the funeral 
            ceremony began. Gash stated that the seekers' time had ended and they 
            needed to leave, to rebuild somewhere else. I asked him what we would 
            do about the Tower and Sestren. In their current state, the seekers 
            could do nothing. It was up to me. I said I'd go back to the Tower. 
            Gash told me it was a bad idea. Azel soon came into the room and said 
            she would also go. She would guide the dragon and I to Sestren. Gash 
            couldn't believe it, we still had a chance to free mankind from the 
            will of the Ancients. He said if I survived my ordeal, to meet him 
            in the valley, and to be on time. We did our good-bye hand shake, 
            and that was that. Before leaving, I made sure to say good-bye to 
            everyone. I first visited Jared, and told him what I intended to do. 
            He wished me good luck, and said for me and Azel to come back in one 
            piece. Next, I went and talked to Zadoc one last time, and he gave 
            me another book called, Tower Report 2. It said that inside the Tower 
            were five separate sections. To move between each section, I would 
            have to pass through the outer areas, consisting of fifteen floors. 
            It went on to describe each floor. It was a lot to take in. Moving 
            down to the bottom floor, I ran into Paet. He had made his decision 
            to join the seekers. He wanted his work to continue and believed he 
            could help people, to make the world a better place. I told him I 
            would return as soon as my mission to destroy the Tower and Sestren, 
            was over. Also, on the bottom floor, inside the spare medical room 
            on the shelf, I found three Gem Lens and two Speed Chips. The seekers 
            had left so much behind. I thought I might as well take it. Before 
            leaving the stronghold, I said good-bye to Gash, on the upper floor. 
            He said to make sure not to forget about the rendezvous point. He 
            had nothing more to say, and told me to hurry along with my important 
            mission. My destiny awaited, I left for the Tower of Uru.</font></p>
