          <p><strong><font color="#000000" size="6">The Path to Sestren</font></strong></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">A long and grueling journey awaited 
            us, as we entered the Upper Floors of the Tower. The entrance that 
            Craymen used was blocked, so we had to make our way to the very bottom 
            of the Tower, floor by floor. Azel instilled some confidence in me, 
            by telling me she believed in me. We arrived in front of the first 
            two gates. They were locked. We flew downward. The Tower's defense 
            system immediately identified us as hostile. Directly below us, we 
            encountered something called a Rotor Pile. Azel told me its main purpose 
            was to keep invaders out, and to control the auxiliary power supply. 
            We would have to deactivate it, to proceed lower. Azel soon said that 
            the Rotor pile required a switch, that could be found on 15F. We flew 
            back up to the two gates. Azel unlocked them. We had a choice between 
            15F West and 15F East 1. 15F West, lead to a locked gate. Azel couldn't 
            open it because the gate was synchronized with the Guardians Reanimation 
            System. Are next move was to enter 15F East 1. We took the elevator 
            at the end of the corridor to 14F East. Another elevator on this floor 
            took us to 15F East 2. We soon found the Rotor Pile # 1 Switch. Now, 
            we could get to the lower floors! We headed back to Rotor Pile # 1, 
            locked onto it directly, and turned it off. Flying downward, we passed 
            three more gates and stumbled upon Rotor Pile # 2. We would have to 
            find the corresponding switch again. The three gates lead to 14F North, 
            14F East, and 14F West. 14F North, brought us to D Units 11 and 12. 
            14F East, brought us to an Elixir Maxis. Lastly, on 14F West, we found 
            the Rotor Pile # 2 Switch, and activated it. Next, we deactivated 
            Rotor Pile # 2, continued downward, and entered a gate that brought 
            us to 13F. We then rode another elevator to 12F. As we entered Hangar 
            # 2, we had to fight the Tower's first guardian. They were twin guardians, 
            and formidable opponents at that! I knew we would see more of them, 
            on the lower floors. I told Azel she could choose to leave and go 
            with Gash, if she wanted. Our journey would only get more dangerous. 
            She said it was her decision to go with me. We continued our journey 
            and entered a lower gate, to 11F. At the end of the corridor we flew 
            into a red sensor, and activated the Tower Alarm. We were then forced 
            to fight a group of monsters. The entire corridor was flashing bright 
            red. Luckily, I found a large switch, directly in front of me. Once 
            activated, the alarm turned off. As we flew further along the corridor, 
            we came upon a strange rotating device. It looked as if the top part 
            had to be perfectly lined up with the bottom part. The dragon locked-on 
            to it, and fired a laser at the device. The top part came crashing 
            down, revealing another monster. After making quick work of this monster, 
            we continued down the corridor, and took an elevator to 9F East Passage. 
            This floor had a series of sensor units and rotating devices. We made 
            sure to time ourselves as we flew through the sensors, and lined up 
            the top parts of the rotating devices perfectly, with the bottom parts, 
            to avoid confrontation with monsters. We exited 9F East Passage, and 
            arrived on the Middle Floors. I had never seen this area before. Azel 
            told me that when the Tower became active, the internal structure 
            changed. Flying downward, we found Rotor Pile # 3. We then rotated 
            a giant Rotor Bridge above us, twice, and entered 9F North Passage. 
            At the end of the corridor, we ran into a dead end. Azel pointed out 
            several hanging devices called Energy Pylons. When the dragon destroyed 
            them, a giant opening was made, leading downward to 8F North. It was 
            here that we found a Berserk Medis, and an Elixir Maxis. We continued 
            to take the elevator at the end of the corridor to 10F, proceeded 
            back to the Middle Floors, rotated the Rotor Bridge two more times, 
            and entered the newly revealed gate, to 9F West Passage. Another elevator 
            at the end of 9F West Passage, took us to 8F West Passage. We flew 
            through an inner passage and arrived at 8F East Passage. It was not 
            too long before we came to another dead end, and had to break another 
            set of Energy Pylons. We proceeded downward to 7F East, and took an 
            elevator to 8F East. We found ourselves inside a chamber, where we 
            had to activate a switch. This caused Energy Pylons to lower from 
            the ceiling. Upon destroying them, we descended to 7F South, and rode 
            an elevator to 8F West. This time, we found another Energy Pylon Switch, 
            within a central chamber on 8F West. Activating it caused more Pylons 
            to lower. Pylons also lowered in the left and right chambers next 
            to us. Next, we destroyed the three Pylons in each of the three chambers. 
            We then entered the hole in the northern most chamber, and descended 
            to 7F East. I then activated the Rotor Pile # 3 Switch, returned to 
            the Middle Floors, and deactivated Rotor Pile # 3, found above me. 
            We soon found a rotating red gate, that brought us to 8F North Passage. 
            Another elevator at the end of the corridor, took us to 6F. We proceeded 
            to enter Hangar # 1. It was here that we had to face the last guardian. 
            Sadly, It spent its conscious existence fighting and dying. After 
            the battle, we entered a lower gate and arrived at 5F. We were careful 
            when flying past the rotating sensors, found on this floor. We flew 
            throughout the long corridor and took an elevator to 4F. In an eastern 
            most chamber, we activated the Rotor Pile # 4 Switch, and headed back 
            to the Bottom Floors. The Tower's defense system was now in total 
            disarray, and we were nearing the bottom of the Tower. Once we were 
            to arrive at the very bottom of the Tower, Azel thought it a good 
            idea to use an elevator that could take us directly to the top. Before 
            fighting Sestren, we would leave the Tower, stock up on supplies, 
            and take care of any side quests. We continued downward, and deactivated 
            Rotor Pile # 4. We soon came upon Rotor Pile # 5. Azel told me that 
            the switch was located on 3F, so we flew upwards and entered a gate, 
            taking us directly to 3F. In an eastern most chamber, we activated 
            the Rotor Pile # 5 Switch. Then, we flew back to the Bottom Floors 
            and deactivated Rotor Pile # 5. Below Rotor Pile # 5, was Rotor Pile 
            # 6! Would it ever end!? I knew this had to be the last one. Azel 
            with her helpful advice, said that the switch was also on 3F, but 
            first we had to enter a gate above us to 2F. Within 2F, we found two 
            locked gates. We soon activated two corresponding Right and Left Gate 
            Switches. The Left Gate took us to 3F, where we found a Berserk Vampire 
            gun part. The Right Gate also took us to 3F, where we found the Rotor 
            Pile # 6 Switch. We activated the switch, returned to the Bottom Floors, 
            and deactivated Rotor Pile # 6. Flying downward, once more, we had 
            finally arrived at the very bottom floors of the Tower. Before us, 
            were two gates. 1F North would bring us to Sestren, and 1F West would 
            bring us to the elevator Azel mentioned, that could bring us back 
            to the very top of the Tower. We entered 1F West, and rode the elevator 
            to the top. There were some side quests we had to take care of, before 
            facing Sestren. We exited the Tower via the opening at the top.</font></p>
