            Life</font></strong></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">We found ourselves in a vast Canyon. 
            The water here was so clear and pure. As we pressed on through the 
            canyon, we came to a stunningly beautiful waterfall. There seemed 
            to be a path hidden underneath, so we flew straight through and ended 
            up in an underground tunnel. As we emerged, we saw schools of fish 
            swimming freely in the crystal clear waters. The dragon being playful, 
            shot one of the fish with its lasers. This caused the fish to jump 
            straight up in front of us! On our journey across the everlasting 
            valley, we came upon a menacing Baldor Queen, who viciously blocked 
            our path. We managed to defeat it, only to run into one more. After 
            the battle, we made our way to another tunnel, which lay hidden behind 
            another amazingly jaw dropping waterfall. Upon exiting, we immediately 
            heard a loud crashing noise, and saw smoke raise up in the distance. 
            We hurried to see what it was. A man's life was being threatened by 
            a massive monster, an ugly one at that. The dragon fired its arrows 
            of light, halting the beasts pursuit. I told the man to go hide in 
            a cave, while we fight the creature. He agreed, and we fought a long 
            drawn out battle. After the battle was won, the man introduced himself. 
            He said his name was Skiad-Ops-Gash, but just Gash was fine. He also 
            said he was a seeker. Even though we saved his life, he asked for 
            yet another favor. He wondered if we could do one last thing for him 
            and take him to Cainus Village. After he said he could help us out 
            by providing knowledge of local ruins and monsters, I agreed. We disembarked 
            for the Village of Cainus.</font></p>

            the morning, if you lock-on to your dragon, you are given the option 
            to name him. Pick any name that is to your liking, except &quot;Dragon&quot;. 
            After naming him, if you lock-on to him again, you can choose to smile 
            or pet him. Don't do any of these yet. Just name him for now. There 
            is a special attack called <strong>Astral Phantoms</strong>, that 
            you can acquire by petting your dragon a certain amount of times. 
            You don't have to pet your dragon, not even once, throughout disc 
            1 and the beginning of disc 2 until: you defeat Drenholm at Uru, and 
            acquire Protect Key # 3 from Uru Deep North. After these events have 
            taken place, you can exit to the World Map and finally return to camp, 
            to begin petting your dragon. All you have to do at this point, is 
            pet the dragon six consecutive times and return to camp once more 
            after the sixth time, to finally receive the technique. This is the 
            earliest point in the game you can learn Astral Phantoms. Special 
            thanks to <a href="mailto:arcengal@hotmail.com">Arcie</a> and <a href="mailto:lance_way@yahoo.co.uk">Lanceway</a> 
            for providing me with each of their views on how to learn this technique.
