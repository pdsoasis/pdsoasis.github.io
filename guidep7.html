            of Cainus</font></p>
          <p><strong><font color="#000000" size="6">A Village of Lost Souls</font></strong></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">When we arrived at the Village of 
            Cainus, the place was completely deserted. Not one soul in sight. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Gash said everyone was attacked by 
            monsters. He wanted to find out why these people were dealt such a 
            terrible fate, so we stayed the night. As we sat by the fire, we talked 
            about many things. Gash told me that his people view dragons as the 
            messengers of the Gods. He also said, if there were such a thing as 
            Gods, the villagers wouldn't have been ripped to pieces, in a feeding 
            frenzy!</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5"> His talk of the villagers sad fate, 
            only led me to think of my own friends violent deaths. I told Gash 
            that I was after a man named Craymen, whom had killed my friends. 
            To my surprise, Gash knew where Craymen's next destination was: the 
            desert! </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">He told me he was also after someone. 
            Someone known only as the Divine Visitor, or so he called it. He hesitated 
            to tell me anything more, so I left it at that. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Near the surrounding area we found 
            a message written by a fellow seeker in cold blood. The message revealed 
            that Craymen himself, led the monsters into the village. That bastard! 
            Will his reign of terror ever end?! Throughout the night my thoughts 
            of revenge only grew stronger. When the sun rose, we were off to the 
            Garil Desert. </font></p>
