          the Council. The Council rules the Town of Zoah, making all of the decisions 
          on how the people are to live, and how the town is to prosper. The High 
          Priest Damon, runs the Council. Basically, he controls Zoah. He is a 
          man with power. He may be a man of power, but he is a good ruler. He 
          may be strict at times, but nevertheless, he is a man of the people. 
          Others seek to gain his power. They would do anything to have it, and 
          would most certainly abuse it. Iv'e seen how the other men of the Council 
          act, and how their greedy eyes fill with hunger, the hunger for control. 
          Ultimate power corrupts absolutely, as I always like to say. Thank the 
          Gods, we have such a humble man!</font></font> </div></td>
