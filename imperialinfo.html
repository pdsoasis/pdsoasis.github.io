            powerful nation called the Empire, will attempt to gain ultimate power, 
            while trying to destroy your dragon in the process. The Empire has 
            gained their current power by excavating and reviving Ancient Age 
            technology. They control a massive fleet of Imperial battleships that 
            can obliterate any enemies that stand in their way. They are greedy, 
            power hungry madmen who have destroyed many surrounding nations, in 
            their conquest for supreme leadership. The man who controls the Empire 
            is the Emperor. He is the seventh Emperor in the Imperial line. The 
            Emperor resides on a gigantic battleship called Grig Orig. With the 
            infinite power of this Ancient Age ship, he seeks to bring a path 
            of destruction to all who oppose him. By controlling the most powerful 
            of ancient technologies, the Empire plans to take over the world. 
            You and your dragon are the only ones capable of standing up to such 
            frightening power.</font></p>
