            with the Advent of Panzer Dragoon Saga</font></strong></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5">The third game in the Panzer Dragoon 
            series: Panzer Dragoon Saga, took an entirely different approach as 
            to what type of game it was and how you play it. Panzer Dragoon Saga 
            is a rpg or role playing game. Rpg's allow you to take the role of 
            a main character or hero. Also, in rpg's, you level up, go to towns, 
            talk to villagers or towns people and buy items from item shops, to 
            help you out on your adventure. All of these things can be done in 
            Panzer Dragoon Saga. The setting of the world is usually that of fantasy. 
            Panzer Dragoon Saga goes down more of a science fiction road. Within 
            the game, you will find long forgotten technologies from an ancient 
            civilization, as well as bio-engeneered monsters which were left over 
            by that ancient, mysterious civilization. These monsters are reeking 
            havoc on what little human life is left. The game may not have so 
            much of a fantasy setting, but it's the engaging story and adventure 
            that counts! Once you start playing the game, you'll find that you 
            will want to know more about the wonderous technologies and monsters 
            created by this long forgotten race of people. You take the role of 
            a young hunter named Edge. Along with his mysterious dragon, an epic 
            adventure awaits, to free the world from the will of the Ancients. 
            Panzer Dragoon Saga takes some of the rail shooter gameplay aspects 
            of the previous games and completely removes the rails. When exploring 
            the environment, your dragon is free to go wherever he pleases, without 
            having to be on a set path, unable to stop. This allows you to freely 
            explore each location with great detail.</font></p>
