          <p><strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="6">The Battle System</font></strong></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5">Panzer Dragoon Saga takes the gameplay 
            aspects and 360 degree movement of the previous games, to create a 
            battle system that is totally new and enjoyable. The rails, or restrictions 
            that prevented the dragon from stooping in the rail shooters, have 
            been completely removed and the dragon is free to move around the 
            enemies a full 360 degrees. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5">The dragon is able to move 4 different 
            directions: front, left, rear and right. This is very similar to how 
            the dragons in the previous games, moved around. The dragon is able 
            to stop in any of those 4 directions, wherever it pleases. Below the 
            screen, is a circular radar, called the battle radar. It's sort of 
            like the enemy radar, showing your dragons location around the enemy. 
            Within this circle, red spots can be found. These red spots represent 
            danger zones. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5">If the dragon stays in any of these 
            spots for a prolonged period of time, he will take heavy damage from 
            the enemies oncoming attack. To the right of the circular battle radar, 
            are 3 gauges. These gauges must fill up one by one, in order for you 
            to use certain attacks. Once one of these gauges fills up, you can 
            bring up a unique in battle menu, by pressing the C button or start. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5">A series of options can be chosen 
            on the left hand side. When one gauge is filled, the first option, 
            allows you to fire Edge's gun. When the A button is pressed, the view 
            switches over to first person, as Edge aims his gun. The gun can be 
            fired at multiple locations on the enemies body, by moving the cursor 
            left or right, to select a location. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5">Certain enemies also have weak points, 
            which you can shoot at. Doing so, will take fatal damage to that enemy. 
            Also, when one gauge is filled, the second option down, allows you 
            to lock-on and fire a series of lasers from the dragon. These lasers 
            lock-on to multiple spots on the enemies bodies automatically. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5">The next option you have, when one 
            gauge is filled, the third option down, allows you to select and use 
            items. You will need to heal your dragon constantly throughout the 
            many battles you will be engaged in. You can also use items to attack 
            enemies in battle, boost up your defense, attack power and speed, 
            heal status ailments, or flee from the battle. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5">When 2 or more gauges are filled, 
            the fourth option down, allows you to select and use the dragon's 
            special berserk attacks. These attacks are very powerful and can completely 
            obliterate most enemies. These special attacks require something called 
            BP or berserk points, to execute. Once you run out of BP, you can't 
            use any of these attacks until you use an item that replenishes your 
            BP. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5">Another option when one gauge is filled, 
            the fifth option down, allows you to customize your gun. While in 
            this menu, you can switch to a different gun if needed. The last option 
            you have when one gauge is filled, the sixth and final option down, 
            allows you to go into yet another special menu and change your dragon's 
            form, just like in the player menu. The dragon can change into a defense 
            form to defend against attacks, an attack form to make his laser fire 
            more powerful, an agility form to move around and fill up the gauges 
            faster and a spiritual form to add more power to his berserk attacks. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5">That's pretty much it for the battle 
            system. It has some of the gameplay aspects of the previous games, 
            while also feeling completely fresh and new at the same time.</font></p>

          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">The original Panzer Dragoon was a 
            rail shooter. In the game, you had the ability to turn a full 360 
            degrees to 4 different directions: forward, left, rear and right. 
            While turning to these 4 directions, your dragon was always on a constant 
            path moving forward, unable to stop.</font></p>

            360 degree movement from the previous games. You can also, move to 
            the front, left, rear, and right. There are some minor differences, 
            when compared to Panzer Dragoon and Panzer Dragoon 2 Zwei. This time, 
            you move around the enemies and the rails or restrictions, that prevented 
            your dragon from stopping, have been completely removed. Unlike the 
            dragons from the previous games, Panzer Dragoon Saga's dragon can 
            stop and hold his position, at any of the 4 directions he chooses.</font></p>
