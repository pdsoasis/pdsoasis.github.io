          </strong>The Town of Zoah is split up into two districts. The first 
          district, The Liberal District, is where the people who have not yet 
          earned the favor of the Gods reside. There are many different kinds 
          of people here including: store owners, gatekeepers, Hunters, bar owners 
          (myself of course), and outsiders. Outsiders aren't tolerated too well 
          in this town, and wouldn't ever dream of going to the Holy District. 
          Although, an outsider can earn the respect of the people, if he works 
          hard enough, like me. I'm was originally from a village in a place called 
          Uru. I managed to open up my own bar, worked hard, and well, look at 
          me now! We have to work ourselves to the bone, to earn our keep. If 
          we work hard enough and show complete faith in the Gods, we may be excepted 
          into the Holy District, a place of holy men. That is, if the Council 
          approves.</font></div></td>
