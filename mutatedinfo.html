          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5">Mutated monsters are a fusion of machines 
            and living organisms that have lost their original function, influenced 
            by the wild and natural selection, the process of a new species arising 
            in nature, selecting other species who's adaptations are better suited 
            for their survival and allowing these adaptations to be inherited 
            by their offspring. Mutated monsters have continued to change over 
            time, passing on their DNA from one generation to the next. They have 
            evolved beyond their original purpose as lifeless living weapons and 
            have gradually reverted back to their original animalistic forms and 
            behaviors. Body parts from mutated monsters can be made into antidotes, 
            medicines, tools and can also be used as a source of food.</font></p>
