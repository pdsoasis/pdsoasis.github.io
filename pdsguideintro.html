          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Well, I've decided to make my very 
            own unique, Panzer Dragoon Saga guide. I know it's kind of late, but 
            I just feel It's my destiny to write one anyway. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">You will be able to read Edge's diary 
            entries one after the other, as he travels throughout the many places 
            of the Panzer Dragoon Saga World. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">Throughout the guide, you will be 
            presented with numbered maps of every area in the game. Corresponding 
            to the numbers on each map, will be the location of each and every 
            item that can be found in that area. You can also view strategies 
            for every enemy, as well as boss battle tactics. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">At the bottom of each diary entry, 
            will be an in depth, step by step, overview of what you had to do 
            in each part of the game (screen shots included). </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">The overview is written by the Divine 
            Visitor (the player, &quot;me&quot;!). So I hope you enjoy it, and 
            get the most out of your play through Panzer Dragoon Saga, even if 
            you've played the game a thousand times already. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="5">For anyone playing this game for the 
            first time, well, using this guide will provide you with everything 
            you need to know about PDS. Have Fun, but be sure not to step in any 
            Coolia's Dung!</font></p>
