          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5">Pure type monsters are a fusion of 
            Ancient Age machines and living organisms. They were created by a 
            long forgotten civilization that once used them for warfare, as living 
            weapons. Their biological genes have been reconstructed and merged 
            with built in weapons. Surrounding their bodies is a hard exoskeleton. 
            This exoskeleton is made of a very hard bone-like material, that can 
            repel energy blasts. These monsters can be found in ancient ruins 
            and Towers. The world has been molded and shaped by the powers of 
            these Towers. When the human population grows too large, the Towers 
            send pure type monsters to kill and bring the human populations under 
            control. The purpose of most pure types is to guard and protect the 
            ruins they are stationed at. Some pure type monsters cant die until 
            they have fulfilled the purpose given to them, so long ago.</font></p>
