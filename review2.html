          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5"> The Panzer Dragoon series is known 
            to have unique and complex story lines, that really make you stop 
            and think about its universe and the events that take place within 
            it. Panzer Dragoon Saga is no exception.With a story like none other, 
            the third entry of this amazing series delivers an unforgettable tale. 
            After watching his friends die at the hands of his now sworn enemy, 
            Craymen, a young mercenary named Edge and an ancient dragon, set out 
            on an adventure of epic proportions. Determined to chase after Craymen's 
            fleet and a mysterious girl named Azel, the only thing on Edge's mind, 
            is revenge. Edge and the dragon will meet many interesting people 
            and go to many unique places. His adventure will soon sway from one 
            of revenge to one of legend. With the will of the Ancients looming 
            over mankind's freedom, Edge will stop at nothing to free mankind 
            from its ominous grip.</font></p>

            very unique and fits the many different settings in the game perfectly. 
            The music also plays a major role in setting up an incredible atmosphere, 
            like none other. The atmosphere in the game is very original and just 
            plain draws you into its amazing world and setting. An evil Empire, 
            floating airships, ancient ruins and technology, a legendary dragon, 
            many different and just plain beautiful locations, a variety of unique 
            and interesting bio-engineered creatures and unforgettable characters.

          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5"> I'm not one to judge the graphics 
            of older games by today's standards. I tend to judge a games graphics 
            by what was possible on the system a certain game was released for, 
            at that certain time. Looking at the Sega Saturn and its capabilities 
            in producing 3D graphics, it's safe to say that Panzer Dragoon Saga 
            was the only game to truly max out the limits of what the Saturn could 
            produce, graphic wise. The developers put all of their souls into 
            making this games world come alive, sweat and blood included. Within 
            the game you'll find: lush valleys full of enchanting crystal clear 
            waterfalls, deserts full of sand worms moving about every which way, 
            burrowing into the ground, underwater ruins laced with many unique 
            sea creatures, day turns to night as you watch the sunset over the 
            amber colored sea, forests full of life and wonder, a traveling caravan 
            never staying in one place, always changing, a town called Zoah, full 
            of many people and many sights to see, the stronghold of the Seekers 
            is illuminated by the gentle light of a massive waterfall. Everything 
            in the game at the time it was released, was just pure beauty in motion.</font></p>

          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5"> The game contains a fun and enjoyable 
            battle system. Basically when in battle, you have the option of moving 
            a full 360 degrees around your enemy. The space your enemy is in, 
            is indicated by a green circle. Any red area within the circle is 
            considered a danger zone. While in the red area, you are open to the 
            enemies stronger attack. Certain sides of the enemy will most likely 
            have a &quot;Weak&quot; message appear. This means your oncoming attack 
            will take considerably more HP than normal. The dragon itself is indicated 
            by a pointer that you can move around the enemy with. There are also 
            3 bars located in the bottom right hand side of the screen. When one 
            bar is full you can shoot edge's gun, by pressing the &quot;A&quot; 
            button, fire dragon lasers by pressing the &quot;B&quot; button, or 
            open the menu with the &quot;C&quot; button. The menu contains the 
            options to both fire Edge's gun and the dragons lasers, as well as 
            the option to select items, special attacks, and the ability to change 
            dragon forms. The different dragon forms also give you different affects 
            in battle like: increased speed, stronger laser power, or stronger 
            defense. This is where a mix of strategy can come into play, when 
            trying to decide which dragon form is best for a certain situation. 
            When 2 bars are completely full, you are then able to use a special 
            attack. Once 3 bars are full, you are granted a special ability that 
            is determined by the dragon form you are currently in. The battle 
            system would have been perfect if you had full control of your dragon's 
            movements, as well as the target pointer, like in the Panzer Dragoon 
            shooters, preferably Panzer Dragoon Orta for the Xbox. Orta's battle 
            system during boss battles, gave you full control of your dragon's 
            movements and the ability to control your target pointer, selecting 
            whichever area on the enemy you saw fit. You could also move a full 
            360 degrees around your enemy while being able to change dragon forms, 
            Just like in Saga, but the dragon changing was done in real time. 
            Team Andromeda, the masterminds that developed the Panzer Dragoon 
            series along with Saga, even stated that they would have liked the 
            dragon morphing in Saga to be real time, but the Sega Saturn just 
            wasn't capable of such a feat, hence they were able to implement it 
            in Orta. I only gave the battle system in Saga a 9 because I thought 
            Orta's battle system is exactly what Panzer Dragoon Saga's battle 
            system should have been. It's too bad the Saturn had so many limitations. 
            All in all Saga's battle system offers a variety of different attacks, 
            is very fun and enjoyable, and throws in a good deal of strategy into 
            the mix as well.</font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5"> </font></p>

            that should be cherished and preserved. With less than 10,000 copies

            environments, the greatest graphics produced on the Saturn and an 
            enjoyable battle system, I have no Choice but to give this game what 
            it deserves,<strong> a perfect 10/10</strong>. Worth every penny you
