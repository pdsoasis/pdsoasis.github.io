          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5">Panzer Dragoon Saga is my favorite 
            video game of all time and will likely remain so. This ultra rare 
            game from the Sega Saturn was released in limited numbers so only 
            a few people got a chance to experience its majesty, but it may very 
            well be the single greatest game of all time. Panzer Dragoon Saga 
            was released only a short time after the ever popular Final Fantasy 
            VII, but in my opinion, Panzer Dragoon Saga utterly demolishes that 
            game. Where Final Fantasy VII was mechanical, Panzer Dragoon Saga 
            was vibrant, featuring beautiful imagery and otherworldly themes. 
            Where Final Fantasy VII's animation and movies looked like puppetry, 
            Panzer Dragoon Saga featured fluid characters with brilliant voice 
            acting. Both games are dramatic. However the drama in Panzer Dragoon 
            Saga really shines forth. The story is deep yet easy to comprehend. 
            Edge is a vastly more interesting main character than Cloud of Final 
            Fantasy VII. Edge is undoubtedly the hero of the game and a good guy, 
            yet he's also not perfect. At first he is motivated by revenge but 
            then finds a quest far bigger than his personal needs. He also suffers 
            torture, emotional anguish, and many internal conflicts. In essence, 
            he is a flawed, fleshed out character. He has become real to me where 
            many other RPG heroes struggle to achieve the same effect and wind 
            up looking like a mass of bad dialogue and terrible cliches. Many 
            of the other characters in this game are also just as fleshed out, 
            even the main villain, who blurs the line between noble and evil. 
            Even the background characters you meet seem like real people and 
            not just random, recycled polygon models. <br>
            <br>
            The battle system is another element that makes this game so great. 
            Personally I find it to be far more refreshing than most RPGs' &quot;press 
            button and wait&quot; battle systems. Panzer Dragoon Saga blends the 
            classic dragon flying and blasting of the first two shooters with 
            RPG elements and an improved version of Final Fantasy VII's time bar 
            system. Like Final Fantasy VII, you have to wait for a charge bar 
            to fill up before you can take action. This time around, though, you 
            have three bars and can achieve a variety of effects depending on 
            how many bars you fill up. However the real meat of Panzer Dragoon 
            Saga is in its revolutionary positional system. You can choose to 
            maneuver your dragon to one of four points around the enemy at any 
            time you wish, giving this game a strategic element most RPGs don't 
            possess. The field is always changing, so maneuvering is a must. The 
            tradeoff for changing positions is that your charge bar stops filling 
            until your dragon is back in place. Another side of the battle system 
            I like is the ability to customize your dragon. You can morph your 
            dragon to change its stats to suit your need and watch as it changes 
            shape in real time to one of hundreds of different shapes. <br>
            Even though the first two games were shooters, they've always been 
            about awesome, otherworldly vistas and artistry and themes about war, 
            biotechnological terrors, and mysterious, sometime ominous histories. 
            It was only natural that the series progressed into an RPG format, 
            as it is in this genre where the universe really shines. The innovative 
            battle system and brilliant writing are only merely pieces of a much 
            larger tapestry. Describing the whole experience is nearly impossible. 
            No game is perfect, however, and if there are flaws, it's that the 
            game is literally the shortest and easiest RPG I've ever played. The 
            battles are breathtaking and challenging, to be sure, but are hardly 
            ever deadly enough to kill you. And most players will probably finish 
            this game within the space of twenty-four hours, even when finding 
            all the secrets. There are also precious few random battles, the curse 
            and the core of most RPGs. However, these are small nitpicks when 
            the overall game is this sweeping, epic, and beautiful. Personally 
            I found the brisk pace of the game made it easier to concentrate on 
            a story that was just the right length. It wouldn't be a stretch to 
            say that Panzer Dragoon Saga may very well be the Star Wars or The 
            Lord of the Rings of video games. <br>
