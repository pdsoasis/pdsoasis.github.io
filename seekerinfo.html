            get friendly with them Seekers, except when you're doing business 
            with 'em, ya know. They know about the Ancient Age, but they're asking 
            for trouble. Did ya know that the Empire started out as a band of 
            Seekers? There purpose was to make life better for us here in this 
            desolate unforgiving world. They eventually lost sight of that purpose, 
            as they gained power. As they uncovered and resurrected more and more 
            Ancient age technology, their minds became clouded and the hope and 
            desire to free the people from the will of the Ancients, became replaced 
            with the hunger for greed and power. Thus the Empire was born. I'm 
            surprised there are still any original Seekers left. They still aren't 
            all that good though. How can the Seekers desecrate the ruins the 
            way they do? Don't they fear the Gods? Tinkering with ancient technology 
            should be forbidden, if you ask me. Technology is the reason why this 
            world is the way it is, an almost completely devastated wasteland.</font></p>
