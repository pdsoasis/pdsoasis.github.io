    <td><div align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5">Throughout the Panzer 
        Dragoon series the Coolia has played a major role in transportation for 
        various factions of people such as: Hunters and Seekers. In Panzer Dragoon 
        Zwei, in the village of Elpis, Coolias were even raised to become mounts 
        for the Meccania cavalry. This creature is one of the few beasts of burden 
        to be successfully tamed and domesticated. By observing the Coolia closely 
        I have found certain inconsistencies with its appearance, over the course 
        of each Panzer Dragoon game. </font><font color="#FFFFFF"> 
        <p><font size="5"> Lets start with the Coolias found in Panzer Dragoon&#8216;s 
          intro sequence. As Kyle and his hunting team ride across the vast terrain, 
          we get a clear view of the Coolia&#8217;s appearance. The Coolia&#8217;s 
          head is quite big and round. It&#8217;s nostrils are also considerably 
          large and connected. Each of its two eyes are small and circular . Lastly, 
          we can also see it has two sets of arms, short in length as well as 
          a small, thin, protruding tail. With a good picture of the Coolias from 
          Panzer Dragoon, we move on to the Coolias in Panzer Dragoon Zwei.</font></p>
        <p><font size="5"> From viewing Panzer Dragoon Zwei&#8217;s intro sequence, 
          It&#8217;s pretty safe to say the Coolia&#8217;s appearance hasn&#8217;t 
          changed much from the first game. In actual game play, this however, 
          is a different story. In Episode 2 as you shoot down the caravan tents, 
          a Coolia and rider will emerge, running for their lives. Looking at 
          the Coolia closely, you will notice its tail is no longer short and 
          thin, but short, stubby, and fat! Another thing to point out is the 
          Coolia&#8217;s skin color is no longer gray, but green. I&#8217;ve also 
          made the observation that it doesn&#8217;t even have its two sets of 
          arms. Whether this is a different type of Coolia from the ones seen 
          in the intro sequence, is not known. With this in mind, we move on to 
          Panzer Dragoon Saga.<br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="5">In Panzer Dragoon Saga as you enter the traveling caravan, 
          you will find a lone Coolia indulging itself with Junio Seeds. This 
          Coolia has a much smaller head than the Coolias found in PD and PDZ. 
          It also has two separate nostrils rather than one connected, large nostril. 
          Its tail is also short and pointy. While visiting the Liberal District 
          in the Town of Zoah, you will eventually find another Coolia walking 
          around near Aldo&#8217;s house. While the first Coolia at the caravan 
          appeared more mamal-like in appearance, this one seems to look more 
          reptile-like in appearance. In the ending movie, we also see Gash and 
          Azel riding another variation of this reptile-like Coolia throughout 
          the desert. Our final Coolia observations bring us to Panzer Dragoon 
          Orta.</font></p>
        <p><font size="5">In Panzer Dragoon Orta, If you have a good eye and look 
          closely, you will see Coolias stationed amongst the Seekers in Episode 
          1. This most certainly is not the best way to observe them. Within Pandora&#8217;s 
          Box after selecting the Encyclopedia, you will find a section called 
          &quot;Creatures&quot;. Listed under Mutated monsters, we are able to 
          view info about the Coolia. We learn that aside from farming uses, the 
          Coolias in PDO haven&#8217;t changed much and are still used for ground 
          travel. Seeing how their purpose hasn&#8217;t changed, it&#8217;s apparently 
          obvious its appearance has changed even more considerably, since PDS. 
          It&#8217;s a shame we can&#8217;t zoom up on it more closely, but it&#8217;s 
          close enough for us to be able to notice some major changes. Just like 
          the PDZ Coolia, it appears that the Orta Coolia, has also lost its short 
          stubby arms. Its tail is now very thin and long, closely resembling 
          the Coolias from PD. Lastly, the most extreme change I must point out, 
          is its beak-like mouth. Now the Coolia has bird-like features as well 
          as reptilian features! So this begs me to ask the question: Are there 
          different species of Coolia?<br>
          <br>
          </font><font size="5">One theory might suggest that Coolias in different 
          parts of the Panzer Dragoon world , or different climates, may have 
          evolved differently through natural selection, to adapt to their different, 
          harsh, environments. The Coolia from PDZ found in Episode 2, no longer 
          needing its short stubby arms, could have evolved to do away with such 
          useless appendages. The reptile-like Coolias from PDS having to constantly 
          traverse harsh deserts, would have evolved dry scaly skin, which in 
          turn would allow them to live in such a dry environment. The Coolias 
          from PDO could have evolved a beak-like mouth for the purpose of breaking 
          open the shells of seeds and nuts. This is also very similar to how 
          Darwin&#8217;s Finches on the island of Galapagos, supposedly evolved 
          different sized beaks to break open various kinds of hard shells. After 
          PDS the environment drastically changed. The PDO Coolias might have 
          needed to feed on a different food source other than Junio Seeds. If 
          the shells of these new seeds were harder to break open than those of 
          Junio Seeds, it might have evolved a beak-like mouth to crack them open!</font></p>
        <p><font size="5">Another more plausible theory would be that Team Andromeda 
          kept changing the Coolia design ever so slightly, therefore making its 
          appearance inconsistent with each new game. However you look at it, 
          there are at least two types of Coolia in the Panzer Dragoon world: 
          Mamal-like and Reptile-like. I have the pics to prove it! Whether it 
          be two separate species, or the act of evolution and natural selection, 
          the constant change of the Coolia&#8217;s appearance over the course 
          of the Panzer Dragoon series must not be overlooked, but closely taken 
          into consideration. <br>
