      <div align="center">The mysterious Shadow Eye, or more formerly known as 
        Gash; the leader of the Seekers. His identity is unknown. An unusual mask 
        covers half of his face, concealing something secret. Just what lies hidden 
        under this mask? Also, his right arm is completely covered by his sleeve, 
        never allowing us to get a glimpse of his hand. We surely will never uncover 
        his secrets but nevertheless, we can speculate and theorize. </div>
      </font> <p align="center"><font size="4"> <font size="5">Let&#8217;s compare 
        the drone Abadd from Panzer Dragoon Orta to Gash. Notice anything similar? 
        Abadd&#8217;s eyes are completely black. If you look closely at Gash&#8217;s 
        right eye, the one concealed under his mask, you will notice it is also 
        black. You can even see some skin surrounding this black hole. Very similar 
        to Abadd&#8217;s eyes. Next, we look at Abadd&#8217;s arms. They have 
        the very same design as the sleeve covering Gash&#8217;s right arm. Although 
        Abadd has some sort of stub under the bone armor covering his right arm, 
        we never actually get to see what&#8217;s under Gash&#8217;s sleeve. Lastly, 
        this may be quite minor, but even Abadd&#8217;s feet are similar to Gash&#8217;s 
        shoes.</font></font></p>
      <p align="center"><font size="5"> Based on these observations, I have come 
        up with two theories. First, Gash may be hiding the fact that he is inevitably 
        a near perfect drone just like Azel. Even though he acts like he is a 
        normal seeker, he seems to know more than anyone about the Ancient Age, 
        and it&#8217;s technology. Gash&#8217;s memory data could have been damaged 
        over time and like Azel, he could have developed human emotions. It&#8217;s 
        certainly possible, considering how human Azel looks. Passing himself 
        off as human by hiding his true identity, he would later join the seekers, 
        and become their leader.</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font size="5"> My last theory delves into the idea that 
        maybe gash is half drone. How could this be possible you ask? Well, think 
        of it like Anakin Skywalker transitioning over to his half robot self 
        known as Darth Vader. Maybe Gash was horribly mutilated while fighting 
        a bio-engineered monster . With his face terribly disfigured and his right 
        arm cleanly torn off by the ancient beast, Gash barely survives and is 
        rescued by the seekers. Facing iminant death, the seekers attempt to rebuild 
        him. Taking certain parts from a deactivated drone, they apply and reconstruct 
        the right side of his face. Amazingly, they are also able to attach a 
        fully functional and operational drone arm, much like Abadds. The procedure 
        is met with success and Gash recovers from the life threatening incident. 
        Relieved to be alive, but also disgusted by his half drone body, he decides 
        to hide both his face and arm, ultimately keeping his new identity a secret.</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font size="5"> They call him Shadow Eye. His true identity 
        concealed. The mysteries that lay behind the mask, he will never show. 
        A half drone or just a normal seeker? We will never know.</font></p></td>
