        <p><font size="5">Episode 1 from Panzer Dragoon, had the dragon rider 
          Kyle riding through a vast body of water full of decimated ruins, while 
          fighting off a variety of ancient creatures, all of which concluded 
          with an epic boss battle against a ship from the Ancient Age. </font></p>
        <p><font size="5">Kyle valiantly, with the help of his dragon, destroyed 
          the massive ship and watched it separate into two pieces as it crashed 
          and sank to its watery grave. Upon entering the Garil Desert in Panzer 
          Dragoon Saga some interesting observations can be made. </font></p>
        <p><font size="5">Ruins similar to episode 1 in PD can be seen sticking 
          out of the sand. Further into the level, a sunken ship makes itself 
          known. Examining the ship reveals it is an ancient ship from the Ancient 
          Age. </font></p>
        <p><font size="5">Could this be the ship that Kyle destroyed 30 years 
          ago? It looks strikingly similar. The top half is nowhere to be found, 
          as it did separate after Kyle destroyed it. </font></p>
        <p><font size="5">Another question remains: if this is the level from 
          episode 1 in Panzer Dragoon, where has all the water gone? Where are 
          the ancient flying creatures that Kyle fought? </font></p>
        <p><font size="5">One theory could be that over a period of 30 years, 
          the water may have been completely dried up, due to the Towers manipulating 
          the environment. </font></p>
        <p><font size="5">Dracolyths can be found flying around in Uru. This is 
          one of the creatures that can also be found in episode 1 in Panzer Dragoon. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="5">When you read the data on the Dracolyth in Panzer Dragoon 
          Saga, it says that flocks of Dracolyth are in a constant state of migration. 
          I believe the Dracolyth's, once their environment changed, left what 
          is now called the Garil Desert and migrated to Uru. </font></p>
        <p><font size="5">Uru is very similar to episode 1 in Panzer Dragoon; 
          it&#8217;s almost a perfect match. Another interesting observation in 
          the Garil Desert is the Blue ruins where you fight the Gigra. Do these 
          ruins have any relation to the palace that Kyle enters, before fighting 
          the airship? They look nothing alike, but could be related somehow. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="5">All of these observations leave some interesting thoughts 
          to be formed about the relation the Garil Desert has to episode 1 in 
          Panzer Dragoon.<br>
