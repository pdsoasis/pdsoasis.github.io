        <div align="center"><font size="5">An excerpt from the Book of Genesis 
          in Panzer Dragoon Saga reads: </font></div>
        <p align="center"><font size="5"><em>&quot;At the dawn of Genesis the 
          Gods created humans. The Gods decided the humans would create their 
          own world. To enable such weak beings to complete such a task, all of 
          the knowledge of the Gods was placed into the souls of humans.&quot;</em></font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="5">Did the Gods or Ancients create humans? 
          They may very well have.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="5"><em>&quot;At the dawn of Genesis the 
          Gods created humans.&quot;</em></font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="5">Think of it this way, the ancients were 
          humans themselves, after many failed creations and incomplete prototypes, 
          created perfect duplicates of themselves that could reproduce, resulting 
          in the perfect drone.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="5"><em>&quot;The Gods decided the humans 
          would create their own world. To enable such weak beings to complete 
          such a task, all of the knowledge of the Gods was placed into the souls 
          of humans.&quot;</em></font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="5">The perfect race of drones, built the 
          towers to create their own environment and change it to however they 
          or the Ancients saw fit. The Gods or Ancients, downloaded or programmed 
          copies of all their vast knowledge into the minds of the drones, to 
          enable such a task to be fulfilled, by the weaker versions of themselves, 
          called humans. The Gods decided that the humans would create their own 
          world or the world the Gods or Ancients wanted for themselves. The ancients 
          did not want to undertake in such a dangerous task so the drones were 
          created for this purpose.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="5">In Panzer Dragoon Orta, information about 
          the drones propose and relation to humans, can be found saying:</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="5"><em>&quot;Humanoid bio-engineered creatures 
          that were produced during the Ancient Age. Many nonfunctional drones 
          have been recovered from excavation sites at ruins, but a few functional 
          samples have been miraculously discovered. Theorists believe that the 
          drones were developed in order to perform dangerous tasks that the Ancients 
          did not want to perform themselves. Therefore, the assumption is that 
          drones were used in battle, and producing armaments, as well. It is 
          from this purpose of labor that they have been given their name. And 
          although drones have been known to exhibit advanced intelligence and 
          are composed of flesh, there have only been a few documented cases in 
          which a drone actually shows human-like emotions or will. Researchers 
          have also discovered that not all drones were created equal. The drones 
          were created in separate classes, depending on their abilities. The 
          higher-end drones were thought to have been created to interface with 
          biological weapons, or various technologies of the Ancient Age. It is 
          known that Azel, who was &quot;kidnapped&quot; from an Imperial excavation 
          site by the traitor Craymen during the Great Fall, was of this type 
          of drone. Some variations of drones are nearly indistinguishable from 
          real humans. Some records show that there were whole tribes of drones 
          living in the borderlands during the years before the foundation of 
          the Empire, pretending to be human.&quot;</em></font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="5">After many failed creations and prototypes, 
          the Gods created the perfect drone. Many of the failed creations were 
          the nonfunctional drones found in the ruins. A prime example of an incomplete 
          prototype that was the closest thing to the Gods goal of a perfect drone 
          would have to be Azel. The fact that there have only been a few documented 
          cases in which a drone actually shows human-like emotions would have 
          to be because a majority of the perfect drones that show human-like 
          emotion are none other than the humans themselves, unaware that they 
          were created by the Ancients. So in conclusion it was not the Gods or 
          the Ancients who destroyed the Ancient Age, but their drone counter 
          parts, called humans that brought about their own destruction. The Ancients 
          foresaw all of this and went into hibernation hoping to return one day.</font></p>
