    <td><div align="center"><font size="5">Thousands of years have passed since 
        a once thriving utopian civilization perished in the dust. What exactly 
        went on to cause the downfall of this ancient race? Very little is known 
        about the ancient civilization's past. Supposedly, a great battle was 
        said to occur in the Ancient Age between the dragons. In Panzer Dragoon 
        Saga, Gash gives us some very interesting information about the downfall 
        of the Ancient Age. </font></div>
      <p align="center"><font size="5"><em>Gash: &quot;The dragons ended the Ancient 
        Age by terminating all of the active ruins and Towers.&quot;</em></font></p>
      <p align="center"><font size="5">It has been said by Zodac the Compiler, 
        that the dragons were created to protect the Towers. Why would the dragons 
        destroy what they where destined to protect? First of all let's go back 
        to the Ancient Age, and to the creation of the Towers. The Towers were 
        built by the Ancients to mold the land as they saw fit, to create a great 
        utopia. In the process the Towers would control the population by killing 
        off any humans that may be a threat to the Towers' purpose. There were 
        many people in the Ancient Age who were against the creation of the Towers. 
        These people were considered to be rebels. The old diary in Panzer Dragoon 
        Saga sheds some light on the creation of the Towers and the rebels' feelings 
        towards them.</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font size="5">An excerpt from the old diary reads, &quot;This 
        world has been molded into its current shape by the powers of a series 
        of ruins we call Towers. The Towers control the environment, breed monsters, 
        and control human populations. Even in the Ancient Age, there were people 
        against the presence of the Towers. The Towers' creators feared these 
        rebels would rise to destroy the Towers, so they created monsters to guard 
        their creations. And the dragons.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font size="5">The rebels went against the will of the 
        Ancients by secretly preparing weaponry with the power to destroy the 
        Towers they despised so much. They created a drone named Azel whose purpose 
        was to open the path to Sestren, which would enable the complete obliteration 
        of the Towers. Unfortunately Azel was stolen from the rebels and her mission 
        would be halted for many years to come. They also created the Light Wing 
        Project and the Heresy program, a program created to destroy the Towers. 
        An explanation of these events can be found in the records of Uru.</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font size="5"><em>The records of Uru: &quot;Report regarding 
        the Light Wing. We have at last succeeded in developing the ultimate form 
        of the dragon. But it is more than a dragon. It is a being far different... 
        Something... perhaps even superior to ourselves... A messenger of the 
        Gods. The Institute, which considered the development of the Light Wing, 
        a renegade project, has ordered us to delete all records regarding the 
        Light Wing... But we have decided to record and seal all data regarding 
        the Light Wing into one memory plate divided into 12 pieces called D Units, 
        and scatter them throughout the continent... hoping one day a later generation 
        would inherit our work...Our latest subject is doing fine. That problem 
        has already been solved by manipulating its lifespan. We shall name this 
        drone Azel. A week has passed since the attack. The drone has not been 
        found. She was probably stolen. She has not been completed yet. I only 
        hope she does not become an instrument of destruction.&quot;</em></font></p>
      <p align="center"><font size="5">So why would the dragons destroy what they 
        were meant to protect? My theory is they didn't destroy the Towers, they 
        defended them against the Heresy dragons in a great war to end the Ancient 
        Age. I believe the rebels created more than one Heresy program. The program 
        was then downloaded into an immense army of bio-engeneered dragons, created 
        by the rebel's themselves. A great battle between the protectors of the 
        towers and the Heresy dragons therefore commenced. The Ancient's dragons 
        waged war against the rebel's dragons. As the arrows of light flew throughout 
        the air, cities were destroyed and many lives were lost. All of the active 
        ruins and Towers were terminated by the Heresy dragons' wrath. As a result 
        of this great war, both sides suffered great losses. Many of the dragons 
        protecting the towers were either destroyed or deactivated. The Heresy 
        dragons also suffered immensely. In a great effort to stop the will of 
        the Ancients, all of the Heresy dragons were destroyed, except for one 
        survivor. This surviving Heresy program would later return when the time 
        arose once more to defeat the horrors of the Ancient Age. The lightning 
        of divine punishment had ended the Ancient Age. Very few of the rebels 
        survived and the last of the Ancients were forced to go into hibernation. 
        The Ancients had lost the war and hoped to return one day, once again 
        to control the world, for they knew the Towers were not completely destroyed, 
        they were just deactivated, sleeping. The only way to completely destroy 
        the Towers would be to destroy Sestren.</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font size="5">The Ancient Age lies in ruins from a great 
        war thousands of years ago. The shadow of the ancient past ominously looms 
        over the peoples heads.They live in fear of the biological weapons created 
        by ancient technologies. When all Hope is lost and the people are in dire 
        need of help, to be saved from the great monstrosities of the Ancient 
        Age, they only have to look to the sky for their savior. The protector 
        of the people, the Heresy dragon that survived the downfall of the Ancient 
        Age, would always rise to protect the future.</font></p>
