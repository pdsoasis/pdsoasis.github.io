        <p><font size="5">From the opening movie of Panzer Dragoon Saga we find 
          that a mysterious girl named Azel was excavated and taken away by none 
          other than the infamous Craymen to be awakened. We get no further information 
          on how or what means Craymen took to do so. Considering that Azel is 
          indeed a drone, could she have some sort of panel or opening which would 
          reveal some sort of activation unit?</font></p>
        <p><font size="5"><em>Azel: My name was inscribed on the bed where I awoke.<br>
          Edge: Bed?<br>
          Azel: The place where I slept for thousands of years. </em></font></p>
        <p><font size="5"><br>
          And we have to take into consideration the bed in which Azel lay dormant 
          for thousands of years. Could her bed be the key to her awakening? Maybe 
          some sort of panel lay hidden somewhere on the bed itself? If not a 
          panel, than maybe the inscription of her name could have had some special 
          use to activate her? Maybe Azel&#8217;s bed wasn't the key to her awakening 
          at all. An external device could have come into play. An ancient age 
          device that Craymen could have found along with Azel. A device that 
          Craymen would have used to awaken her from her everlasting sleep.</font></p>
        <p> </p>
        <p><font size="5">One last theory must be discussed. We all know that 
          Azel had a great bond to Atolm, her dragon. When Azel was awakened so 
          was Atolm. But could the rebirth of Lagi at the excavation site have 
          some sort of affect on Atolm&#8217;s awakening? Since all other dragons 
          other than Lagi were solely created to protect the Towers. Lagi&#8217;s 
          presence would surely be a threat to the Towers as Lagi&#8217;s goal 
          would be to destroy them. Atolm sensing Lagi&#8217;s awakening would 
          have awoken from his deep sleep, triggering Azel&#8217;s awakening as 
          well.</font></p>
        <p><font size="5">All of these theories may have very will been true, 
          but another even more mysterious question needs to be answered. How 
          did Craymen know how to awaken Azel in the first place? The obvious 
          answer would be, Craymen learned his knowledge of ancient technology 
          from the Empire, as they were once Seekers. The Empire has a great deal 
          of knowledge regarding the ancient age, but their knowledge can only 
          go so far, and I don&#8217;t think they have an answer to everything. 
          It may be a long stretch but it's not so far off to believe that maybe 
          Craymen himself could be a descendant of the Ancients as the Ancients 
          are believed to have been human. Towards the end of the game within 
          the tower, we find Craymen activating all sorts of ancient age technology 
          such as the circular energy transporters and the many viewing devices 
          which showed all parts of the Panzer Dragoon world. Even Paet would 
          probably have trouble operating such devices. Craymen had some sort 
          of deep secret which was never revealed to the player. Once he activated 
          Azel the procedure was probably kept secret by the empire until Abadd&#8217;s 
          awakening.</font></p>
        <p><font size="5">The way in which Azel was awakened is another mystery 
          of the Panzer Dragoon world. So many things we are left to wonder about. 
          Seeking explanations we try to come up with our own theories, only to 
          be left pondering if they are truly correct. Just how are drones awakened 
          from their endless sleep? We may never truly know that answer.</font></p>
