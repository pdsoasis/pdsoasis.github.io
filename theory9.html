        <p><font size="5">The ongoing question we&#8217;ve all had within our 
          minds while playing the Panzer Dragoon series was: just who were these 
          &quot;Ancients&quot; and what exactly did they look like? Were they 
          human? Could they have been alien, but humanoid in appearance? Maybe 
          they were made of pure energy? Who knows, but the answer may very well 
          be hidden within Panzer Dragoon Saga. <br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="5">Throughout Panzer Dragoon Saga, there is a point in 
          the game when you get to witness the resurrection of an ancient battleship 
          called Shellcoof. Its resurrection occurs at a place called Georgius. 
          For those who have no idea what I&#8217;m talking about, Shellcoof was 
          a ship that existed long ago, built by the Ancients to do their dirty 
          work. It played a major role in Panzer Dragoon 2 Zwei, as well. I won&#8217;t 
          spoil anything, if you haven&#8217;t played that game. </font></p>
        <p><font size="5">So, what I&#8217;m trying to get at here, is when Shellcoof&#8217;s 
          resurrection is complete, look at the back of the ship. Do you see anything 
          strange or even surprising? Well, I see a face, body, and two arms, 
          with six fingers at the end of each arm! </font></p>
        <p><font size="5">My theory is that Shellcoof was built in the Ancient&#8217;s 
          image, a symbol of their greatness. It could be my mind just doing what 
          all minds normally do, and that is making a face out of abstract imagery, 
          but it&#8217;s too obvious to be just that, and shouldn&#8217;t be overlooked. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="5">There is clearly a face on the back of that ship, and 
          it looks more humanoid rather than human, in my opinion. If you look 
          at the face, its appearance is quite animal-like. It even seems as if 
          it has two sets of ears. The first set, depending on how you look at 
          it, could even be a set of antenna, that it uses for sensory purposes. 
          On the other hand, they could in fact, just be long protruding ears. 
          You decide! </font></p>
        <p><font size="5">The second set of ears look more human-like, in that 
          they are more round in shape. Looking at its eyes, you can see that 
          they are very thin. Having to squint all the time, maybe would suggest 
          that the Ancients must have had eye sight problems! Below the eyes, 
          we can assume it most likely has two sets of nostrils, the second set 
          being larger than the first. The head also seems to have bushy fur coming 
          off from the left and right sides, as well. </font></p>
        <p><font size="5">This contributes to its more animal-like appearance. 
          From the head, we move down to the neck. The neck seems very wide, with 
          small appendages sticking out of it. This may be an insect-like trait, 
          but who knows. </font></p>
        <p><font size="5">Moving further down gives us a look at its chest area. 
          Don&#8217;t laugh, but it looks like it has tiny pecks, and a set of 
          abs! Also, we see two sets of arms, with six sets of fingers at the 
          end of each hand. The Ancients would have had to use their fingers constantly 
          to create such fascinating technology, I&#8217;d guess. It doesn&#8217;t 
          have much of a lower half. The very bottom could very well be, slithering 
          tentacle-like appendages, that it uses to move. It&#8217;s just a crazy 
          assumption. Well, that sums it&#8217;s body structure up.<br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="5">I&#8217;d also like to add that the Ancients could have 
          had a pure energy form, rather than a solid form. I say this because, 
          all of their ancient bio-engineered creations use and have massive amounts 
          of energy. </font></p>
        <p><font size="5">The Ancient Age monsters throughout the Panzer Dragoon 
          world, can constantly fire massive arrays of insanely powerful lasers. 
          It takes great amounts of energy to do this, and it&#8217;s just a theory, 
          but maybe the Ancients instilled a bit of themselves into each and every 
          monster they engineered. </font></p>
        <p><font size="5">Also, when you destroy Shellcoof&#8217;s engine rudders 
          in Panzer Dragoon Saga, energy streams grab your dragon and send it 
          to the back of the ship, where the face is located. </font></p>
        <p><font size="5">These energy beams will try to stop you from bringing 
          forth the ships destruction, flinging your dragon back and forth violently. 
          Are these beams the Ancients themselves in the form of energy, trying 
          to stop you from destroying the ship? It&#8217;s a possibility. </font></p>
        <p><font size="5">Just look at the dragon, it can take solid objects, 
          convert them into pure energy and store them within its body (see my 
          Turning Solid Objects Into Pure Energy Theory)! <br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="5">In conclusion, your mind may very well be taking an 
          abstract image and bringing that image together so it makes sense, a 
          face. This may be so, but take it with a grain of salt. We&#8217;ve 
          always wanted to know what the Ancients looked like, and with the bleak 
          possibility of another Panzer Dragoon RPG, we may never get that chance. 
          You&#8217;ve got to admit though, if this image is in fact that of an 
          Ancient, the Ancients were one crazy looking race!<br>
